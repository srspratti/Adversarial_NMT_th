thank you .
is everyone anybody ?
after a week .
oh my god !
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
we were poor .
home ?
that &apos;s not ...
solar technology is ...
we head@@ ed .
we love innovation .
we love entertain@@ ment .
oh my god .
three out 10 .
ste@@ phen wat@@ h .
it &apos;s very quick .
that &apos;s hard .
the sun goes on .
yes , hell@@ o .
amazing , right ?
that &apos;s wrong .
long , yes .
the only chance .
don &apos;t happen .
but it &apos;s .
yeah , in a way .
music as language .
which is sing .
they need time .
it &apos;s interesting .
here is it .
hold twice .
thanks . thank you !
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s terrible .
ta@@ -@@ da !
great trick ?
we know that .
and he says ...
a few less .
we were .
does that sound good ?
from se@@ attle ...
exciting exciting .
there &apos;s no way at all .
yeah , good after@@ noon .
it &apos;s already done .
this is the system .
robert ben@@ p@@ ta .
what a fish .
not very sustainable .
let &apos;s call it .
that &apos;s me .
what did you do ?
the farm is incredible .
they make them worse . &quot;
may i be honest ?
and i was an artist .
that was fascinating .
you see it immediately .
we need energy mira@@ cle .
that &apos;s great important .
this is a wish .
b@@ g : thank you .
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar with what ?
what was the result ?
but you know what ?
not very often happening .
pretty good , right ?
why do we do that ?
it &apos;s not a country .
because you know what ?
yeah , i know .
how do we know ?
why does this happen ?
these days are over .
what do you want to do ?
thank you very much .
this was the out@@ come .
can we change it ?
just do your job .
this is the last .
good work ! yes !
flying cat@@ s .
so let &apos;s see .
yeah , good after@@ noon .
that &apos;s it .
yeah , that &apos;s true .
what are media today ?
they have similar principles .
thank you very much .
this is our present .
yeah , milli@@ seconds .
let me tell you .
we can do it differently .
and it needs to go back .
in@@ efficient .
wonderful , dam@@ n ?
that &apos;s efficient .
all the environ@@ ment@@ ation .
not gu@@ il@@ t .
what then they say ?
not po@@ is@@ oning in there .
we can do that .
all interested in me .
len@@ to , slow .
i thought about this .
what &apos;s happened here ?
centers were set up .
i don &apos;t know .
oh . a moment .
okay . thank you .
so they come up with al .
and that &apos;s important .
they use your hands .
there are two ways .
they rec@@ ru@@ ited again .
i go in here .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
or a bom@@ b .
so how does this work ?
i don &apos;t think so .
here &apos;s an example .
what do these people need ?
hey , why not ?
somehow that doesn &apos;t work .
1,000 , very good .
but i went .
so she was back .
and she did .
and i went .
what &apos;s happened here ?
this is happening today .
these people deser@@ ve money .
here &apos;s the video .
so they do that .
players don &apos;t sit around .
there is no normal .
oh , you know .
that &apos;s very good .
some more .
it op@@ ens the door .
why not live longer ?
so it &apos;s true .
it has sensor@@ s .
they &apos;re all important .
it &apos;s essential .
so where are we going ?
very different term .
you can go .
i was facing him .
you could see manhattan .
so they knew everything .
it &apos;s gener@@ ic .
i have a question .
i was ama@@ zed .
that would be okay .
in 2010 , she@@ tics .
sti@@ cks her .
but you know what ?
how interest you are .
who will make it sec@@ ure ?
i wonder .
it &apos;s against justice .
i mean the sou@@ l .
what is the sou@@ l ?
i can say everything .
we were 20 people .
what should it be done ?
this is pre@@ cis@@ ely .
let us don &apos;t call it .
but what eat your fish ?
there is no food .
i don &apos;t love that question .
that &apos;s pretty cool . &quot;
an un@@ he@@ vi@@ al challenge .
first of all , we have the population .
that &apos;s what most people know .
so what do we need to do ?
we need to spread the message .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
what did you think happened ?
and i understand that .
and why is this ?
people were mad .
the data came in .
it &apos;s called paul off@@ it .
i agree with you .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
yeah , here it is .
but that didn &apos;t .
he had had experience .
there &apos;s an old study .
they had no mass media .
so , what does that mean ?
very expensive im@@ state .
here &apos;s another example .
they even hurt .
why should we do that ?
i &apos;m a writer .
and i always had .
why not thinking about that ?
not dis@@ he@@ ar@@ ten@@ ed .
this is fe@@ li@@ x .
his own story .
you see that there &apos;s no way .
thank you for listening .
how do we work together ?
they had no books .
now , what does that mean ?
we &apos;re not producing ourselves .
it &apos;s not going to do that .
does someone see a particular one ?
you have to understand that .
sorry a chance .
they can &apos;t have bone .
but that &apos;s not a protection .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , yes ?
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we are too many .
but where are we useful ?
in china , it was different .
but the wrong things .
the work &apos;s work .
you think of compar@@ ison .
okay , a few more .
but it gets worse .
is this your mind ?
j@@ k : both .
imagine the camera .
this is the shor@@ eline .
that &apos;s a great question .
it kee@@ ps you fresh .
yeah . all right .
that &apos;s a great question .
my name is am@@ it .
i literally grew up in india .
only further fun . much fun .
the answer is no .
i created one .
first of all , nar@@ row .
almost iden@@ tical structure .
what do i look at ?
let me sum@@ mar@@ ize .
that &apos;s how the graphi@@ cs looked .
there were re@@ mix@@ es .
and then it became international .
h@@ h@@ h@@ h .
it &apos;s my grand@@ father .
after just a trip there .
my gut gut again .
is it a photograph@@ y at all ?
is it about the lights ?
what makes the illusion ?
here &apos;s another example .
but there &apos;s one more .
have you seen these guys ?
who are these relationships ?
that &apos;s not true of emotions .
it sounds may be ridi@@ cule .
that sounds crazy , right ?
the game is by 2007 .
now i &apos;m going to finish up .
i want to ask you a little question .
thank you .
from conflict , they emer@@ ge creativity .
i don &apos;t think so .
or maybe it may be possible ?
some of them came and went .
maybe 10 times .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i swe@@ ar .
be a mind .
d@@ k : 6@@ 0,000 .
so what happened then ?
aw@@ w@@ w , thank you .
is it going to have my size ?
am i going to paint the color ?
thank you very much .
good after@@ noon , all together .
here you see the city .
it really enjo@@ yed him .
now here you see it .
his name is temp@@ t .
she did that very often .
i had a good life .
it feels great .
you see the water .
and it was even better .
actually , i did two er@@ ror .
he went up and down .
what else can we do ?
crisis . death . cat@@ astrop@@ he .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
and many people forget this .
it &apos;s the guy on the left .
and it did .
i felt right .
we love technology and creativity .
and then it happened again .
he went back here .
and fortunately , he did not die .
there were still fish .
we have three main groups .
there are online crimin@@ als .
priv@@ acy has to be provi@@ ded .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
i meet children .
this is about .
it has billions of them .
but what do we do with this ?
and this op@@ ens a map .
i never forget it .
i never forget that .
i was de@@ va@@ st@@ ated .
we lost the contact .
it looks like this .
the only country in the world .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our fight .
we are re@@ lie@@ ving each other .
it would be in@@ tra@@ c@@ table .
it would be knowledge .
thank you for your attention .
does it make it curious ?
because you can train that .
it was just not invented .
and how did that feel like ?
it &apos;ll always be more like this .
my wife told me she told me .
an au@@ ti@@ stic student .
we can &apos;t just do that .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
because i can say all that .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
it didn &apos;t have the sou@@ l .
this is a natural thing .
again , they have it again .
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
now when it &apos;s in the moment , it &apos;s the g@@ arb@@ age .
there are four and a half thousand people .
it just cannot be technologi@@ cal .
they always say , why ?
no problem can be a problem .
and here &apos;s the repres@@ entation .
and then they put up .
and of course , this is incredible .
i only loved two ge@@ loved .
&quot; of course , i said .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
don &apos;t taste very good .
i wanted to support them .
2.@@ 5 to one , great .
he showed up the al@@ ga@@ e .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
they really loved it .
i wouldn &apos;t re@@ com@@ men@@ d it .
the answer is no . &quot;
no@@ wa@@ days , everything is simply too easy .
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
but i felt bad .
they could have done it better .
so let me remember .
everyone needs a gold glass .
okay , that &apos;s really gu@@ ard .
so , you know .
is this reas@@ on@@ able ?
so the question is : how ?
what is this thing ?
this is god , you know ?
this happened to be a christ@@ mas .
let me be kog@@ i . &quot;
the orange tra@@ ctor .
what &apos;s the point now ?
what actually happened ?
this is a game for outside .
for example , this perception in context .
anybody know what that is ?
re@@ mind is going to work still .
so it &apos;s a sphere .
then i can trans@@ fer that all over .
you can &apos;t store energy .
we dep@@ end on two countries .
and that &apos;s what we take .
and we are too many .
every accident is a resource .
so not like de@@ to@@ x .
play is not al@@ bert .
and finally , contr@@ ast impli@@ es .
they create an epi@@ c story .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
so , we can .
and frank@@ ly , who &apos;s common ?
i wanted to do common school at the time .
what would you like most ?
how many people would vote creativity ?
how about fit@@ ness ?
is it all just unique ?
now , how did this happen ?
these changes are in come .
and that was 19 years ago .
now , i was the next .
play doesn &apos;t just mean children &apos;s games .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
they become computer in free .
in the morning , before play .
first foreign , second .
it@@ al@@ y won . yeah .
they saw the big stat@@ ement .
and then everybody went down .
the data didn &apos;t available before .
the whole building was made of water .
they can have these cloud .
they can play with different ways .
i appreci@@ ate a@@ we .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
that was the beginning of the journey .
she did it for three years .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
they want to feed the world ?
creativity had to somehow come out .
so they saw some ma@@ gical .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
what lea@@ ther@@ ers have we learned ?
so it &apos;s a major challenge .
that &apos;s a lot of volu@@ me .
how would our craft look like ?
this has the largest impact .
under the other hand , others should not suff@@ er other things .
it was a huge success .
and then it res@@ ali@@ ze him .
who is most successful ?
so that &apos;s the good news .
the same thing , only bigger .
i almost never co@@ ok .
don &apos;t take any budget .
very sc@@ ary .
because what &apos;s happened here ?
and that &apos;s what he actually says .
so paul is terror@@ ism .
no one &apos;s ever said this before .
the data is all the time .
so you feel good . &quot;
it works like this .
but the key is , ...
and the shape plays a part .
everyone talks about happiness today .
and here is a surprise .
they didn &apos;t change the history .
they have so much inse@@ curity .
i should not do that .
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
how can we help ourselves ? &quot;
maybe even in our mobile phones .
and that &apos;s not something yet .
they connected these two people .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us that much .
but that &apos;s not so quick .
we don &apos;t .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
but they do the job .
that really made me sad .
i got some fear of technology .
somehow the children don &apos;t do anymore .
we use the energy of the sun .
i &apos;m going to show you one thing .
her mother moved her alone .
today , it &apos;s 2.@@ 3 million .
it &apos;s not our citizens .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
what do they try to do ? &quot;
sometimes i get too close .
so i went to the court .
as soon as the ju@@ dge saw me .
that was mad .
and there &apos;s good news .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
the white lines are for people .
we all love baseball , right ?
and there are hundreds of them .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work , right ?
but , you know what ?
they come from the artists .
and then something weird happened .
and that worked very well .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the power plant can explo@@ de .
there was no problem at all .
this is very ris@@ ky .
li@@ ther@@ over technology .
tell me about this world .
what other br@@ ands do you like ?
and it took 18 months .
i see this pl@@ us-@@ hand .
now this is one of the pictures .
these are all the meta@@ data .
now this is what i &apos;m going to show you .
maybe i shouldn &apos;t say that .
but it was very sad .
basically they do the same thing .
and that &apos;s what we did .
and again , he showed him four .
the two called me .
we are in an area .
this picture is from this place .
one place is south korea .
think of your own decisions .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
okay , there are some .
well , let &apos;s see .
what &apos;s happened that day ?
it &apos;s very simple .
the history is not over .
no was never an opportunity .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
and it was an incredible experience .
i don &apos;t have to worry !
so , we started a vi@@ vi@@ ly .
people were still happy .
it was my first sun@@ fire .
in fact , he colle@@ cted fish .
my name is brian gold@@ man .
they share their experiences with others .
and it starts with a doctor .
and they beat a 25@@ 7 .
and is the cru@@ x .
but there are two problems in this .
i started feeling better .
but very slow , it just thought it was .
she was back and die .
she asked the nur@@ se .
my second mistake was worse .
i learned everything .
how and what did he percei@@ ve ?
the people over the ur@@ in .
nu@@ d@@ le@@ mis@@ sions , yes ?
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can go back to our budget .
but we need that in a total .
but very effective , yes ?
to ask , what is the right ?
as we think of north .
we say in sustain@@ ability .
that &apos;s just the minim@@ um .
you can show , i was there .
if you go to that , yes ?
we can rein@@ vent everything else .
i started an institute .
and the reason for writing it is to write .
that &apos;s completely tri@@ vi@@ al .
this must be the opportunity to be able .
because for me , she &apos;s memory .
he was already on se@@ ch@@ y .
and it &apos;s still no interpretation .
this is like speaking .
and this sounds very different than before .
so the first step to a interpretation .
you know what is nei@@ d ?
so , before all , you &apos;ve been di@@ o@@ ked ?
i feel something through my head .
no , no , no , that &apos;s not .
it &apos;s interested in fire@@ s .
there he was sig@@ ning .
here , they have this little mechan@@ ism .
and you feel it already .
for a while , these other networks .
you can &apos;t do anything like that .
our maga@@ zin@@ es are read by millions of millions .
one has these advan@@ tages and risks .
and there are many reasons for this .
do you want to holes with holes ?
the truth is more like this .
we started 15 years ago .
sun@@ light and co2 are a method .
i think it &apos;s dis@@ gu@@ sting .
these ri@@ vers are taking ra@@ pid .
this is the memory .
this picture remin@@ ded me of something .
let me leave you the quie@@ t .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty l@@ oud .
here he is la@@ id up the sun .
the people that live .
was a pretty common project .
and that &apos;s very much in the beginning .
i want to show you that .
anyway , to navi@@ gate .
on the book , the image .
let &apos;s do a little bi@@ ota .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
so often , in the third grade .
i don &apos;t know who recogni@@ zes .
anybody know what three seconds ?
also , a very exciting phenomenon .
and what does that mean to the designers ?
and it depen@@ ds on phosp@@ hor@@ us .
otherwise you can &apos;t have a teeth .
it makes it leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a in children .
that &apos;s not necessarily bad .
and that made me so much .
the out@@ come of it was dis@@ soci@@ ha@@ l .
dark ur@@ in . dark .
that &apos;s ide@@ ology , not science .
that has nothing to do with science .
so , look what happens .
i take my sle@@ ep@@ y back .
and the goal is very simple .
i think the kni@@ fe in my hand .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
what &apos;s a story like ?
so the cor@@ relation is small .
no , i &apos;m really serious .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
and everyone in this room has to .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
happy produ@@ c@@ tivity . fantastic !
five million people are using it every month .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
so this crazy story could voices .
we &apos;ve been playing for 199@@ 4 .
students are dis@@ rup@@ ted by notes .
what about lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty ?
but what &apos;s going on in the future ?
we &apos;ve reach@@ ed a kind of equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um .
who don &apos;t want healthy children ?
these are un@@ resi@@ stic .
i remember my first fire .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
it turns out that it &apos;s hard .
a billion people today are star@@ ving .
so it stands right in the middle .
so nature is the nature of nature .
auto@@ matically run to the right idea .
the hot project today .
it &apos;s bus@@ y with to@@ od@@ work .
yes , that &apos;s the kind of data .
how far away you do ?
and then we said , okay .
very simple , this is going to come .
so i just started playing .
music is medicine . it changes us .
in the assu@@ mption of maybe two percent .
i fell from this fish .
they took the chan@@ n@@ els .
do you do that for the children ? &quot;
these things are logi@@ cally cor@@ rect .
now i see gre@@ g le@@ mond .
i &apos;m listening to you , thank you very much .
i could draw . i could paint painting .
it was really changed the dynamic .
today , 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people live .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
for energy , this was one of them .
next thing : nuclear power .
that &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
anyway , we need a solution .
but there &apos;s another reason .
architec@@ ts and engineers , to happiness .
i tried a little more carefully .
there are also space record .
and that can make a big difference .
who could have been able to look at this ?
but then you really want deep inside .
it seemed to be popular .
it should experience the experience .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
this is a picture of the object .
so we measu@@ red his movement .
now , that &apos;s not exactly right .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
they actually get fund@@ ing with one .
here &apos;s the o@@ live oil .
here &apos;s their mar@@ ker gang .
here &apos;s a descri@@ ption of the street .
what do you want to do that ?
we need to move complexity slowly .
oh my god . oh my god .
you see something funny here .
all adults suff@@ er .
there &apos;s something hidden in me .
for a year , we had not had a cent .
her father died for her birth .
the de@@ fe@@ at would have been too simple .
who would ever want one wish ?
but it requires a lot of planning .
and every morning , i went to that .
oh , my time is over ?
they &apos;re spre@@ ading out .
they don &apos;t give up the government .
we didn &apos;t write this ap@@ p .
how do i get her away ? &quot;
and these are the neu@@ ral structures .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
that &apos;s sc@@ ary .
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
i call this the bright tiger .
just be , who you are .
the game begins -- sil@@ ence .
they can do that all the time .
but the truth is far away .
and this video is real time .
he can only use your eyes .
what do you do about this ? &quot;
isn &apos;t that over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming ?
we won a couple of pri@@ zes .
and i had to gone out of town .
that sounds terri@@ fying .
that &apos;s a child play , right ?
that &apos;s not a point in my mind .
do we really want to go this way ?
okay , you really want to know this ?
i went to prison -- hard .
that was more to stress .
we need to think about what brand .
what else ?
we are a smaller brand .
where words would you describe afghanistan ?
h@@ mm@@ m , my brand ?
i really love being beautiful clo@@ th@@ es .
i love things that are different .
thank you very much for pati@@ ence .
they &apos;re very good .
the film hasn &apos;t been issu@@ ed .
they want to ori@@ ent themselves in the museum ?
thank you , but the best part is coming .
they were inst@@ antly pres@@ sed gene@@ tically .
baseball is full statistics .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
they gave their blood pressure up .
their family gather@@ ed out .
why did i have been in medicine ?
the other had died .
i don &apos;t take the same path .
i &apos;m the new un@@ defined doctor .
it &apos;s transforma@@ tional standards .
because we live on a water planet .
it &apos;s not going to be docum@@ ented .
and no one seems to rise .
b@@ j@@ stock s@@ und@@ in .
and the answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
they sell cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
i have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot;
priv@@ acy is not about the debate .
so le@@ go made it possible for everyone .
the ones are color@@ ed .
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
i tried to understand it .
now we &apos;re doing this with air@@ planes .
it can know where we are .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
these are the ap@@ sar@@ as .
i learned that from my grandmother .
my brother star@@ ed me .
this is maybe trans@@ mit@@ ted to publi@@ sh this .
we &apos;ve done a lot of things .
all of these generations only require few milli@@ seconds of seconds .
we don &apos;t really know much about this .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
i started with my usual talk .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
they &apos;re an inspi@@ rational person@@ ality .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
in fact , we &apos;ve re@@ defined poverty .
&quot; risk is not a simple game .
so it &apos;s created two cir@@ cles .
i see the d@@ al@@ mati@@ an dog .
it &apos;s got to work out as a present .
what will it take tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ two milli@@ seconds ?
this is another paradig@@ m shift .
i attemp@@ t that through an un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented .
and the curi@@ osity does not learn .
the environment , make less g@@ arb@@ age .
that &apos;s just a little bit less de@@ fau@@ lt .
so that can &apos;t be a pi@@ g .
no tree is carbon neu@@ tra@@ l .
we can support them to be good .
the side product is clean water .
we can support them to be good .
but with the real design , please .
in two hours , they &apos;re building all over the place .
and so , now look at him .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been repres@@ ented .
so basically a trans@@ lation of the trans@@ lation .
this is such a trage@@ dy fra@@ ction .
his personal impres@@ sions of the se@@ ens .
especially when he died .
they say what they feel .
the mechan@@ ism is from lying .
behind the seven mountains and so forth .
a particularly nice story , as i do .
and then he can walk .
because now you can use a three-@@ sentence .
now , you know about school .
in this three-@@ sentence , three sent@@ ences come in .
you think of it as a box .
we also have very close data .
it just simply didn &apos;t know you know ?
language is the expression of human mind .
they went through each other .
now this level of intuition is very important .
they are the countries of someone .
15@@ 6 countries ship our tv chan@@ nel .
now let &apos;s get something else out .
yeah . she &apos;s not doing anything else next .
this is my super@@ market . no big .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they are all ex@@ hau@@ sti@@ ve questions .
it &apos;s a little virus of bacteria kill .
we have unique elements here .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
and this picture was called at@@ las .
we went through initi@@ ating ritu@@ als .
this is a year of water flow .
but we start to see a change .
this is one , part of her .
it &apos;s a redu@@ ction of america .
we need to get way , and very quickly .
so that sounds very common for the first time .
and that is what they do .
but i &apos;m going to talk about that again .
no , no , no , a long story .
i want to explain a little bit .
maybe even again , another gli@@ mp@@ se .
so from modern in the computer community .
just to say , what is information ?
they look at the back@@ wards .
a d@@ al@@ mati@@ an , right .
he had had 20 minutes of music .
does anyone know what that is ?
not even the truth will be free .
we &apos;re tw@@ ent@@ y of it .
the guy in the middle not so much .
we now have mas@@ ks in this country .
it &apos;s cru@@ el millions of people .
they have them . they always have them .
we don &apos;t want them to have see@@ ds .
and why ? genetic trans@@ formed food .
because we don &apos;t want genes around them ?
so , he &apos;s here . right .
also , the do@@ se is a subject .
now , i &apos;ll show it to you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
everyone would love to make people happ@@ ier .
they are gone . they &apos;re disappe@@ ared .
thank you . i have a question for you .
dan@@ iel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : sure .
we get an absolutely flat line .
thank you , dan@@ ny ka@@ h@@ nin@@ man .
and there are people .
so the first exciting pri@@ mit .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe that .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
what do you think happens next ?
i &apos;ll read you the input one .
but it &apos;s not just about words .
wi@@ dri@@ ties are easy to our lives .
we can help ourselves a little bit .
sex@@ ually re@@ production is coming into the image .
it cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars .
it &apos;s the way it &apos;s gone .
this will take place in apri@@ l apri@@ l .
i hope you &apos;ll for@@ give me .
&quot; the best in industry . &quot;
the ko@@ f had co@@ iled him .
and e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cally , it was a cat@@ astrop@@ he .
they &apos;ve literally la@@ sted the le@@ vers .
i &apos;m an exper@@ t for relationships . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
schle@@ ps ? i was completely conf@@ used .
he sha@@ sted his head , no .
this is an e@@ col@@ o@@ gical network .
how do you feed the world ? &quot;
it was really profound .
so what can we close from all of this ?
it &apos;s not enough half or a quar@@ ter ? &quot;
and you can see again the whole thing .
it &apos;s great that number goes up .
so that &apos;s a tough nu@@ t .
and what do you do with the waste ?
and it &apos;s also under@@ lying these sources .
that holes really solve the fuel problem .
it should con@@ tain the two elements .
there are many great books on this subject .
there have got some things that need to come together .
what do i design ?
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
this is just an in@@ sur@@ ance way .
and even l@@ om@@ bor@@ g is thinking about .
you can predict that . why does this matter ?
they run the process ; they understand it .
there was never a time like this .
there &apos;s another aspe@@ ct story about history .
and by the way , this is just the work@@ place .
i &apos;m a red@@ und@@ ant person .
the goal of the whole group is transpar@@ ency .
so -- means not that optimi@@ stic .
no , that was what i thought .
and it &apos;s also very ris@@ ky .
there &apos;s a whole bow@@ l whi@@ p that eat a lot .
we &apos;re talking about co@@ w , fresh .
how would you describe your brand ?
they brought their pictures , right ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
i &apos;m going to act directly with the artist directly .
they can be logi@@ cal and intui@@ tively intui@@ tive .
let &apos;s think about nuclear .
i think that &apos;s cool .
it &apos;s completely based on a particular goal .
poli@@ tely all appl@@ au@@ d .
i have him here on my laptop . &quot;
now we saw the rever@@ se effect .
and i want to read you a little bit about this .
now , who &apos;s prepared for this journey .
here are two different dir@@ ts .
actually , there was no vir@@ mal video .
he just wanted to share a rain@@ bo@@ w .
he had a lot of natural foot@@ s .
there was j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ a .
even the cat@@ s look at this video .
somebody made an ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned version of it .
he pulled back to the sil@@ ence .
he died through the history .
i &apos;ve never met him personally .
so that &apos;s the cause for this project .
look at what she does .
but the game is sha@@ per .
we &apos;ll go back to these guys later .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
they had a concept of blue blood .
and women argu@@ ed successful .
conditions don &apos;t exist with us .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
let &apos;s start with sun@@ day .
let me tell you a little bit about that .
it &apos;s called &quot; me with me . &quot;
let &apos;s start with the true one .
and anyway , it@@ al@@ y won out at the end .
you see the ti@@ mel@@ ine .
the main man win@@ ds me .
the roof was also covered with water .
you see that the building works .
you see ro@@ ber@@ to dan@@ cing .
as an artist , my connection to me is very important .
and that was the out@@ come .
mt is fully paraly@@ zed today .
regular people are not available these devices . &quot;
don &apos;t in@@ sur@@ ance itself .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
it all comes from our own po@@ ckets .
make it possible -- they all over here .
this is a picture of a cir@@ cl@@ ing .
two minutes later , three things happened at simul@@ ating three things .
that &apos;s usually not the rou@@ te .
it turns out the eng@@ ines .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
tho@@ u , tho@@ u : you too should wish .
that i had written that crazy things .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
now look at this cur@@ ve .
&quot; a p@@ ale blue do@@ t . &quot;
what are these three people bringing together ?
so far , this was a problem of super@@ computer .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
maybe i did it with good reason .
the emergen@@ cy staf@@ f , all str@@ ands .
and that was what i felt .
but i moved forward to these questions .
alone , and without support , and without support .
i &apos;m going to ti@@ re as we all .
shor@@ tage shor@@ tage is u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
what you need is a new medical culture .
i &apos;m a human . i make er@@ er@@ ror .
it was an ac@@ cen@@ tive .
they exp@@ and@@ ed five in@@ ches .
she wasn &apos;t un@@ comfortable .
the difference is then being lost as loss .
you lose an ar@@ ten@@ er animals .
but western governments help themselves .
but today we are far beyond this .
they ta@@ p their internet together .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
so li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its &apos;s source is open .
they were inspired by us .
so i followed my gut .
we worked late late the night .
&quot; they didn &apos;t let go . &quot;
i believed , everyone could do that .
the bank is from a different place .
it may , until it &apos;s la@@ stly .
this is a hum@@ ble little ap@@ p .
so scot@@ t takes a ferti@@ le .
boston didn &apos;t just have a call center .
something very strange here .
the next step happened in these communities .
let me do a little bit of mu@@ tations .
so it &apos;s created a feedback .
i lived in par@@ alle@@ l worl@@ ds .
it can know how we hold it .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic pres@@ ent@@ ations .
she was the daughter of a sla@@ ve family .
my cou@@ s@@ ins everywhere .
this land is different than 40 years ago .
many of my cli@@ ents are very young .
i meet people in death cells .
i think our identity is thre@@ at@@ en@@ at@@ ed .
it &apos;s going to be too close to touch .
do you want to go and listen ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
i learned a few very simple things .
and there &apos;s a central point .
now i &apos;m going to do a little thing about this .
i &apos;m pleas@@ ed to be there .
so , that was my primary motivation .
and the list can continue to continue with infin@@ ity .
what are actually ar@@ a@@ stic models now ?
now if you &apos;re going to take a little away now .
and the two are also here today .
at any rate , they are doing that inside .
in the beginning , the society is through the language .
that the theme of environmental media is a global war .
now everyone is trying to recognize something from this pattern .
now look at the d@@ al@@ mati@@ ans .
that &apos;s the way it &apos;s the nor@@ m .
that &apos;s the so-@@ called o@@ si@@ t-@@ model .
now , all of you eat p@@ ie .
now i &apos;m ad@@ ding a b@@ ass .
the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem is much critical .
don &apos;t forget the environment , use less energy .
and everything is pac@@ ka@@ ged , or content .
this is bal@@ an@@ ced in china in a second .
because that &apos;s what it is , right ?
or take a li@@ f@@ ts@@ hi@@ p .
imagine mo@@ z@@ art efficient .
there &apos;s every time pressure , every time it comes down .
so not sav@@ ali@@ zing , avoid , avoid .
for example , the s@@ ne@@ ak@@ er , yes ?
no , we determin@@ e what &apos;s inside .
it &apos;s all inside , it &apos;s useful .
it &apos;s all com@@ pati@@ ble of it .
so , help me do a little bit .
remember the wind again ?
this is the main mechan@@ ism of evolution here .
and the problem is not the technology .
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma of what ?
so that &apos;s how the super@@ market is .
we don &apos;t produce identity ; we inv@@ ent them .
but here is what you should have thought .
here &apos;s some on the ham@@ p@@ tons .
i could go right back to my house . &quot;
now , this carto@@ on is taking some stat@@ ement .
three : es@@ cal@@ ation of expec@@ tations .
your problem is they have too little .
it &apos;s good for us to do that .
we &apos;ve tried to ask more important questions .
they laugh@@ ed more than her here .
ini@@ tially , we &apos;ve only sig@@ ned under@@ paper .
the new chromo@@ some went into the cell .
they only listen to them and then start talking .
it &apos;s a challenge for nine to offer .
this is the machine below gene .
and they had to re@@ move what we did .
they &apos;re all back on their way back .
seriously , the bottom line is ri@@ gh@@ ted .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid all of these things .
oh , jes@@ us , what a thought !
the land on the land dro@@ pped .
if you don &apos;t , li@@ ap@@ s are somebody else .
and that &apos;s great because we need that .
and if you don &apos;t , dan@@ cing still your dance .
the ice ice is flo@@ ated with red .
the water numbers have shif@@ ted .
care of america . find out more .
i start with a bunch of simple examples .
we &apos;ve forced them . pu@@ ff .
it &apos;s the most powerful human fe@@ ature .
this has to wake up at zero .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
the internet and the services is a mira@@ cle .
the last three of the five have sum@@ mar@@ i@@ zed me .
and there are these la@@ ger@@ ies problems .
this is going to be key to this ac@@ id of ac@@ id .
we need to work for more research .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
they don &apos;t have time in power consumption .
what did you think happened with these design students ?
let &apos;s just do that as a machine .
my grand@@ parents were pres@@ enting this number 70 .
my parents are the 80 on the caf@@ es .
they live with help from che@@ mo@@ syn@@ thesis .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
what has happened that we could do that .
and they &apos;re not only going to die .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
we &apos;ve gone , which hasn &apos;t worked .
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we re@@ f@@ use trans@@ duc@@ tional food .
you know that science is not a company .
sh@@ at@@ d . lab@@ el .
it &apos;s kind of like a po@@ tat@@ o@@ le .
there &apos;s somebody who had no childhood .
what ? that really fre@@ ak me out .
sorry about that , makes it crazy ?
let me show you very close .
&quot; great , &quot; i said .
now , can you play them in blue ?
mean@@ while , the instru@@ ments continue to evol@@ ve .
pic@@ as@@ so says , wait only .
so it &apos;s supposed to go from the outside to people .
i got it special here .
these sent@@ ences are absolutely logi@@ cal and cor@@ rect .
they say , there are no predic@@ tions .
and yeah , i &apos;ll go again a sli@@ p .
and then it looks like this .
our goal was to say , okay .
that has no one ever done that in the world .
and then of course , the natural light is re@@ duc@@ ing a smart grid .
so , intelligent grid , a huge issue everywhere .
and in the time , they can re@@ act again .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
so each conc@@ ert is a different conc@@ ert .
it kind of su@@ mm@@ ed us .
remark@@ ably , he was still deli@@ cious .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
how is the food commercial ? &quot;
every morning they fly 2@@ 40 miles to the farm .
and every ev@@ ening , they fly two miles back .
let us look at the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical model .
it &apos;s all right there . it &apos;s all online .
you can get into a particular year .
they can jump directly to a particular ex@@ ception .
now , i &apos;m going to vote the issue .
we &apos;re talking from in@@ tra@@ gi@@ in information .
i was completely curious about science .
i did not let me dis@@ close it .
so that really ble@@ w my mind .
imagine a plane full of smo@@ ke .
mon@@ day : color is a force .
spen@@ ner@@ day : self-@@ confidence is the key .
and i &apos;m going to sum@@ mar@@ ize that for you .
it was created about four and a half years ago in it@@ al@@ y .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
second hal@@ f-@@ time . end of regular play time .
but the reality is increasingly un@@ predic@@ table .
i want to show you a little first story here .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
that means something that is built in the city .
on the left hand , you see a little boat .
so they communicate like this -- their fing@@ ers walk along their feet .
so i spoke a few months later on a conference .
and we need to get a lot better at this device .
it was something that we knew .
so i think we need to be leaders .
i don &apos;t want to make anything shif@@ ting in life .
i did not want to go ; i love my life .
so that made sense to fit it together .
so again , the fit@@ fit@@ t@@ led was really good .
so that &apos;s where we need digital security .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important .
you have to spread it as far as you can .
what do you think the answer will be ?
don &apos;t want to have something to do with the movie .
actually no , that was not the mistake at all .
these sorts of things have a positive effect .
and this is a milli@@ on-@@ dollar companies .
they should tell me something about my brand .
man # 3 : i &apos;m the pattern guy .
it &apos;s like i want to be .
m , dance with me . thank you .
there &apos;s a lot of fortun@@ es co@@ ach@@ ing .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
thank you for invention of behavi@@ oral economics .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
i don &apos;t get in the real life of this feedback .
but it &apos;s definitely not opti@@ mal@@ y .
people suff@@ ered . people f@@ ought .
what we want is to create the future .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better than that .
and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s good .
maybe we can see wi@@ dri@@ ties as change .
it was summer and i had fit@@ ts .
and then , of course , it &apos;s made cli@@ ff .
teachers didn &apos;t know that something has changed .
i usually would take out the need@@ le .
raise your hands . let me see .
we &apos;ve been here for about 1@@ 30 years now .
i &apos;ve tried to keep the body .
i wanted to re@@ build health from a disease .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
so they put it ; save the shoes .
ladies and gentle@@ men , their rela@@ tives .
so two pa@@ irs , every single baby .
so just imagine for a moment .
mean@@ al@@ ty is coming in many different shapes .
they are in the back part of our bodies .
so we have this terrible idea .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
first of all , i thought that this was a game .
and here is a lot of very well-@@ plan@@ ned .
she has a butt@@ on , and from .
next week comes next week .
we wonder@@ ed , and no one knew it .
i work in solar technology industry .
today , a lot of people announ@@ ced government .
scot@@ t was approach@@ ing human .
that our contribu@@ tion to the system is choo@@ sing .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
all the ones were , they began to divi@@ de .
and i try and do this again with another generation .
we are in the middle of this transi@@ tive area .
with 16 , i started drawing books .
the story@@ telling of the story always needed more senses .
my mother was the yo@@ un@@ gest of your 10 children .
after@@ wards , it &apos;s about the combin@@ ation of different images .
i said , &quot; okay , grandmother . &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
but anyway , we seem to be satis@@ fied .
there &apos;s a couple of very interesting things .
we &apos;re always creating new ten@@ ths and conflict .
we want to do something about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
he came up with me and hu@@ mili@@ ated me .
then he scre@@ aming me on the ear .
and i have to say , there was power .
now , i went to the court room .
here is the opportunity to do something .
what would you say to someone ?
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
the third technology : categ@@ ory .
the first is a classi@@ c , apple .
it hasn &apos;t come out in other countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the dem@@ o .
you come up with two ways -- very simple .
you walk around , and am@@ at@@ ty .
you can zo@@ om very easily and zo@@ om out .
but the best thing is , in a second .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
this would be somebody who is completely intui@@ tive .
i mean , nobody ever saw a partic@@ le .
the rest of the time , they are del@@ r@@ alized .
it su@@ its thousands of square miles .
so the theme of the day : financial saving .
i think i might have heard more hands .
ee@@ at@@ e@@ e ! no , thank you .
my fourth technology : predic@@ tions for complexity .
mot@@ ors , ge@@ ars -- four choices .
now it was fri@@ day , that &apos;s true .
no one has to give businesses green .
my grandmother never for@@ gotten my life .
but so many of the people around the years have been .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
there had to be another piece of law .
life had not changed for cent@@ u@@ ries .
my mother said to me a few minutes later .
my mother asked us to embra@@ ce her hand .
but it has an un@@ expected turn .
and ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , a reali@@ stic spot .
is it about the details , or colors ?
and let me show you a simple example .
it was much less , and i fell in a hur@@ ry .
and we want to make this stuff available for everyone .
they can &apos;t put them wrong .
let me show you how you work .
it &apos;s not a matter between priv@@ acy and safety .
and that argument makes no sense .
what do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates ?
this is al@@ fre@@ d gon@@ cess@@ eric .
the question is , why people accept that .
there can be a sequence of change .
i thought , i could be able to support myself .
we still think they &apos;re origin@@ ally .
she suppor@@ ts when others speak their mis@@ er@@ r@@ ors .
and we increase our expec@@ tations constantly .
three words : remember ?
and i went back to work .
i remember as though it was yesterday yesterday .
and i asked them , and i went to the proce@@ dur@@ es .
you know how you call a 4@@ 00@@ ter ?
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
and this is very important in medical research .
it &apos;s a game that says meaning .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
we &apos;re thinking today about energy shor@@ tage .
it &apos;s connected through oxygen and silicon .
notice two things about this cur@@ ve .
all over the place , there &apos;s no wind .
what we &apos;ve got is the story .
it &apos;s a game , i have to say that .
we understood that the weather is global .
and what is it like actually there ?
information is any difference that makes a difference .
i don &apos;t know who knows this picture .
the first question is , are we too many ?
that means we need to get phosp@@ hor@@ us back .
and we see that it makes it happen .
but you can &apos;t replace the phosp@@ hor@@ us .
if you fall in love , efficient ?
then i say , heart bi@@ te , yes ?
not all of them will be comp@@ ani@@ able .
but today , we only talk about biological systems .
technical cir@@ cles are the same .
from the bir@@ d-@@ age era , for the machine age .
in the countries where people come from money .
it &apos;s sort of about an ac@@ r@@ act po@@ op .
have a nice example of this .
and in my you@@ th , i said , expec@@ tation .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
you can &apos;t talk about interpretation in the beginning of it .
a phr@@ ase with his own breath .
but maybe you can also re@@ vote them .
why do i have to afford a little car ?
he ten@@ ds to dec@@ ei@@ ve them and not own themselves .
because we cannot live without life .
so , we can &apos;t afford these things .
do you do that and then you experience the sentence .
in fact , we know that something else is the case .
the analy@@ tics don &apos;t make a stat@@ ement of reality .
this is a completely un@@ pre@@ ci@@ ble development patterns .
there are those who are much more spa@@ tial .
and we can navi@@ gate this very simple way .
i &apos;m very gr@@ ate@@ ful for the re@@ ference here .
if you want them to make them hyper@@ -@@ links between the images .
you know what the answer to this question is ?
and we &apos;re so often inv@@ enting ourselves as much as we want .
and the world that we lived in was like this .
everyone in my manhattan neighborhood is gone .
i &apos;m wearing je@@ ans , almost all the time .
but de@@ tro@@ ss is not always a bad thing .
these are foot@@ age on a couple of seconds of a half seconds .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
so we dama@@ ged about 50 of the magne@@ ts .
i have maybe another 40 years working in me .
if your job is dan@@ cing .
we are all born . we &apos;re bringing children around the world .
they have seen it in the news .
in fact , coal is not de@@ fau@@ lt .
and they also feel their mov@@ ements and ten@@ sion .
so here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
we wanted to develop an education for speech lear@@ ners .
now he &apos;s got a tra@@ ctor in the scene .
i can change the sequence while she goes around .
so , what is bio@@ ha@@ cking ?
now that should actually be a jo@@ ke , but this is actually not a jo@@ ke .
so , what do projects like us do now ?
it &apos;s virtual reality , and it &apos;s very without computers .
or they had no photo@@ graphi@@ cs .
the only thing that had happened was her head .
and in that mind , memory was true .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say .
think about that . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
now , i understand that . i do .
this guy was a hero , jon@@ as sal@@ k .
and why ? because paul has made a v@@ acc@@ ine .
have you all picked up your vi@@ tam@@ ins ?
so we walk away , and where are we going to walk ?
and i &apos;ve got all kinds of little pro@@ p here .
there was no can@@ tal@@ ou@@ t-@@ chip electr@@ on .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 1@@ 1,000 years .
and some of it worked , and you don &apos;t .
we don &apos;t want companies to live .
yeah , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s put it .
it &apos;s right to create mor@@ ts , patent gra@@ m .
now they understood the creation of the prototyp@@ ing .
they need , and we don &apos;t give them .
definitely . that &apos;s definitely what i want to do .
i mean , many of you in this room have a lot of you .
that too , the do@@ se will play a role .
but now you can &apos;t count my finger , right ?
the people in the side rooms come in .
but one of them is clearly worse than others .
and they ask them , what happens to these moments ?
there seems to be a dis@@ agre@@ ement .
now , would you pick the same vac@@ ation ?
what are the emotions that are measu@@ red ?
that &apos;s not about how happy one person lives .
this guy is short just a conc@@ ern about an ep@@ y vic@@ tor@@ ic .
you expect an addi@@ tional billion player to the next decade .
so we have a total , 1.@@ 5 billion players .
and i found that i found out very exciting .
because actually , this guy is not interested in evidence .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have anymore ?
we have already 20 percent in germany .
these were the very first calcu@@ lations six years ago .
is that great , then we have a business model .
now , fortunately , there &apos;s a lot of studies now .
for na@@ than@@ iel , music is mental health .
i had with this beauty about a couple of months ago .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
they &apos;ve rever@@ se the flow of the water .
i mean , they &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
the fl@@ am@@ gos eat the sh@@ ells .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit slightly different .
so , after all , my two passi@@ ons came out .
we can move these things into different examples .
and so i met a slightly unusual decision .
so that was a highly strange experience .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s coming on ? &quot;
these stupid movies don &apos;t bring us money .
there &apos;s a link , a link to each other .
i think the first thing is , the curi@@ osity says .
today , i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
probably one of these numbers has to come close to zero .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
the ocean for hundreds of years .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the main problem here is like aids .
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be on top .
i thought , let &apos;s put the po@@ ker effort .
or , are they a down@@ -@@ at@@ tri@@ c ?
it &apos;s nat@@ ung and it &apos;s just nat@@ as@@ ure .
because then our problem would even be larger than that .
you know how many people see this ted@@ talk ?
you know , i had the idea for a film .
it was &quot; in infin@@ ity , forever . &quot;
the answer is likely to be , &quot; no . &quot;
they wanted to have nothing to do with the project .
so exactly how are we going to see in the movie ?
i want to help you cal@@ m .
all right , what &apos;s the brand ger@@ m ?
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
these are people who are my world@@ view .
what is the next thing you want to talk about .
a little bit more about her , which isn &apos;t them .
there &apos;s a lot of ko@@ o@@ ks sitting there .
these results were hard for many hours of hard work .
and that &apos;s what those brand have done .
and how did that work for you ? what &apos;s successful ?
that &apos;s just online -- no press , no television .
and finally , we should wel@@ come transpar@@ ency .
empathy is called &quot; they wel@@ come transpar@@ ency . &quot;
here we are , and this is the picture .
another favorite picture of mine , star night .
and that was an experience of hu@@ mili@@ ty for me .
we found that it &apos;s really going to move it .
we &apos;re far away from this goal .
well , let me show you a little bit more about this .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
because it doesn &apos;t really feel the money .
let me show you an example of what i mean .
in 2010 , it had been 23 million vie@@ ws .
and that &apos;s not just related to gender .
i &apos;ll try and say , well , that &apos;s logi@@ cal .
same , i think , i &apos;m going to end up with games today .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future .
8@@ ,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
look , dr. ke@@ an has changed his thinking .
and the same thing about the three months too .
do you want to be sex@@ y and self-@@ conscious ?
how about good health ?
i want to do it by non-@@ ster@@ i@@ le . &quot;
how could it be that we do this ?
as i said , am@@ anda is wearing our eleph@@ ants .
the dog ! i used to eat mine .
so , we learn and the laws of play .
but are we going to make the best part of our play@@ ful ?
both of them are completely den@@ se .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
we see that in all sorts of areas of human life .
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
we see the same thing in dis@@ ab@@ led movement .
but how do you do that in practice ?
tu@@ es@@ day : con@@ form@@ ity is completely over@@ st@@ ated .
i &apos;ve got something i want to show you .
here are the results that we &apos;ve just got .
so that they can track the whole movement .
each ice mountain has its own individual person@@ ality .
this is something like our cam@@ el .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to them anymore .
i learned that in a moment everything else is everything else .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
and that is the planning behind it .
i want to tell you how we found that .
this is mo@@ ore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
the kid in me is really enth@@ used .
it also points to other places of the book .
you can say things that have influence in the world .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
she had the last word in every family battle .
i remember it as if it was yesterday .
wealth , not de@@ bt , affected the out@@ come .
the sil@@ ence is o@@ ars .
the question of death pen@@ al@@ ty is an interesting question .
i appe@@ ar@@ ance it to get both of them .
and i said , &quot; yeah , really . &quot;
and i went over , and i just heard only .
we want the number of he@@ at@@ ers .
we want to create mass dis@@ orders . &quot;
thank you at ted . thank you .
and i &apos;m going to come up with a character in the book .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
there &apos;s a program that may already be familiar with some .
we have access to the tools with exponenti@@ al-@@ technology .
we have the passion of a di@@ ly inno@@ v@@ ators .
well , really good , maybe a regular star .
i was a stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward student .
and let me go back to my high doctor .
and that was not hard to do that .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a doctor .
they were brea@@ thing brea@@ ks and was blue angel@@ s .
this is the kind of text@@ sh@@ ame .
at one point , i thought he would have im@@ hor@@ ti@@ zed .
all that su@@ ites up er@@ ror .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
you know that he was here in 18@@ 35 .
so , there &apos;s a nice little to@@ dynamic .
no apple ever s@@ laugh@@ ed in the same way .
my mother suff@@ ered from the boat .
i didn &apos;t know with the lab@@ els .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about what you &apos;re talking about .
i said to my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i met the decision to go to the u.@@ s .
if i tell reality , i &apos;m photograph@@ ing photo@@ reality reality .
so i think the bas@@ ics are very simple .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
the under@@ water por@@ tion comes from a rock .
i &apos;ve put my job at 95 k@@ g .
we all have navi@@ g@@ ated systems in our cars .
and we want to put this in a global scale .
today , i &apos;m going to report today from un@@ expected disco@@ ver@@ ies .
al is a hy@@ dr@@ an in boston .
and all of this will lead us to a large question ...
this is the call center for service and information .
and that worked . appl@@ ause for scot@@ t .
but what &apos;s happened to &quot; the &quot; with &quot; with &quot; the &quot; with &quot; with &quot; the &quot; with &quot; the &quot; with &quot; the &quot; with &quot; the &quot; with &quot; the &quot; with &quot; the &quot; with &quot; the &quot; with &quot; the &quot; with &quot; the &quot; with &quot; the &quot; with &quot; the &quot; with &quot; the &quot; with &quot; the &quot; with &quot; the &quot; with &quot; the &quot; with &quot; the &quot; with &quot; the &quot; with &quot; the &quot; with &quot; the &quot; with &quot; the &quot; with &quot; the &quot; with &quot; the &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot;
and in this case , it saw a neighb@@ or .
good night , swe@@ et mar@@ ch . &quot;
and we use this word with such con@@ temp@@ t .
people seem to think politics is sex@@ y .
if you could just show the slide here .
the transition happens . we can feel it all .
so each tr@@ un@@ p was slightly different .
the writing of the dna was an interesting step .
these are the rest of those , er@@ asing the rest .
sa@@ g , again , again , this process . &quot;
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities yet yet .
now we &apos;re doing that with dri@@ ll and machines .
this is a dead tur@@ tle .
if you gener@@ alize it , this is what happens .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of animals .
and that &apos;s why not as a large loss .
they become more ex@@ ten@@ er because we catch them .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
the corpo@@ rate head@@ quar@@ ters is right here .
that means that the ants wei@@ gh@@ s much more than we do .
and the third area , which explains itself .
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
another example is called the so-@@ called virtual reality .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
and that &apos;s what we really like to look at now .
i &apos;m also going to resol@@ ve what &apos;s inside there .
a research se@@ me@@ ster to the subject of natural interface design .
every society is pre@@ domin@@ ated by a pri@@ mar@@ -@@ medium media .
so how do we work in there ?
it &apos;s a little bit more likely to get my glas@@ ses .
and then this is coming back . it &apos;s coming back .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
how can i make a one-@@ friend@@ ly interface ?
and less us@@ able , it &apos;s like that .
that &apos;s why how to think about that .
and as i said , it first started first .
there is no over@@ population problem .
no , it &apos;s exactly the right thing , right ?
it &apos;s the shape of re@@ wire , right ?
because we don &apos;t actually do the things that we don &apos;t do .
in fact , the notes are very va@@ gue and un@@ pre@@ cis@@ ely .
i will never play more like this , like in this moment .
i cannot play today like in 20 years or 20 years .
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
so listen , if the music is played .
and at all , you work much less than i am .
because artists have a separate ra@@ ti@@ o to the gap .
this is the idea of the sou@@ l .
by the way , this is the hard part in my talk .
the first two sent@@ ences that are logi@@ cal cor@@ rect .
i would rather continue to do this work that i love .
the grand@@ father of this old man suff@@ ered .
every major picture is the beginning of a se@@ g@@ ged .
but these are all streets in the u.@@ s .
many of them are covered by faces , etc .
they get a model that comes from the entire world .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
and the world that we live in now looks like .
and the question is , are the good news news or bad news ?
paraly@@ sis is a con@@ sequence of many choices .
you know nothing to do in this golden fish glass . &quot;
our steps at the digital world of life were exponenti@@ ally .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve grown net signals .
we &apos;ve tried to get the point of auto@@ ma@@ tion .
we &apos;re now focused on green@@ -@@ scale generation .
we re@@ gar@@ ded them , they re@@ pair them .
we dance in the temp@@ le and become god . &quot;
and everyone knew that it worked , right ?
everyone knew that the geni@@ us was a little bri@@ ck .
walk and squ@@ aw@@ le leon@@ ard co@@ hen .
his full labor process has changed .
not only bad , but the worst of all time .
i &apos;m going to write a second story , because that &apos;s my job .
if we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
and i &apos;m in@@ spir@@ ing ol@@ Ã© , and so on for you .
it gro@@ ws in winter and s@@ hr@@ in@@ l in summer .
but the volu@@ me is much bigger than ever before .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
clean coal , they &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
and that inter@@ active portra@@ its will be true .
this is an inter@@ active tri@@ ck@@ ler meeting .
i &apos;m looking forward to all of you !
the biggest difference between you is the process of time .
we repe@@ ated this exercise with the same students .
and i took a while to find out .
we haven &apos;t had children &apos;s hand@@ h@@ ame in this country yesterday .
we walk into the arms of plac@@ e@@ bo industri@@ es .
and you know what my answer to all of this ?
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
mani@@ ops is something that half a billion people eat .
they wouldn &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ?
i &apos;m going to explain it for you , and then explain him .
i &apos;m just going to keep the kni@@ fe in my la@@ kes .
i take the hand away , and here &apos;s the kni@@ fe .
this is my meat , and i can turn it around .
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive case .
there &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
and here are two patients . these are their recor@@ ds .
because they have special fac@@ ul@@ ties of process@@ ing .
that &apos;s not working at all .
the living self has not voice voice in this choice .
i mean , i &apos;ve r@@ ar@@ ely seen flat lines .
currently , we spend three billion hours of hours of hours of hours of hours of time .
this is one of the classi@@ c expres@@ sions of games .
they never get a job that they can &apos;t solve .
this const@@ ant feedback doesn &apos;t exist in the real life .
as a con@@ sequence , we are building more social social relationships .
ed@@ ward ca@@ chter is a scientist .
and these were the first of human beings , and they were design tools .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
they shared the queen in two hal@@ ves .
so , let me say , let &apos;s start the world &apos;s dir@@ ty games .
ant@@ ony@@ m : healthy , powerful .
here &apos;s the actual version of this device .
in the course of this journey , i learned a lot .
so if sound says , there are no sou@@ ls .
and that &apos;s the kind of g@@ and@@ y .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
so i &apos;ve been living a lot of fish in my life .
so you could feel good to sell it .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ come the destruction .
he said , &quot; fish ? i know nothing about fish .
&quot; look at your b@@ ars , p@@ ink .
but for many people , this is a little too radical .
with pi@@ vo@@ t , you can get into a decade .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
as a child , i used com@@ ic books and so on .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio did not know yet .
i was basically obs@@ essed with disco@@ vering deep sea .
we went back to the re@@ treat of ti@@ tan@@ ic .
the analy@@ tics don &apos;t make a stat@@ ement of what &apos;s true .
it changed my way to making films , completely .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t move yourself .
you have to be prepared to take risks like this .
so , going to become a climate change for you .
also , the power for them very important .
the second factor is the services that we use .
so here are some natural light wor@@ s .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
one of the manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ?
a lot of speech to 20@@ 50 percent redu@@ ction in 20@@ 50 .
where is the biggest interest in what &apos;s really going ?
b@@ g : an energy break@@ through is the most important thing .
in nuclear sec@@ ance , there are other innovative companies .
those who do the scientific argu@@ ments are very little .
1@@ 1@@ m is the highest thing i saw .
i sold the entire country around the country , worldwide .
we don &apos;t want iran to make the wea@@ pon .
so we start with a wind drug .
and if it wasn &apos;t , unfortunately , unfortunately , it doesn &apos;t do anything .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15@@ ,000 lines of code .
now , in this area , there are not thousands of thousands of sur@@ ve@@ ys .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and ag@@ gressi@@ ve .
so think about that . that attac@@ king is gener@@ ic .
that &apos;s the con@@ sequence that we have to ask .
they are in the united states , in europe and japan .
how much money is needed to realize that ?
there are some places that we can turn to .
but what this picture says is a problem .
and the film is called the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; re@@ tail ever . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great dun@@ es .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other mar@@ ks .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in this ?
the next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what else can they do ?
and i think there &apos;s almost one con@@ tradi@@ ction about that .
or , are they like a down@@ -@@ at@@ tri@@ cian ?
are you ei@@ gh@@ ty and mon@@ un@@ t like 300 ?
there &apos;s not even this online . no threat .
we should put the bak@@ er in the c@@ age .
so you just go to google ta@@ x .com .
you can see in all those muse@@ ums .
i love this guy ; his expression is un@@ able .
you zo@@ om in . you can really go into it .
that &apos;s star night , probably never before .
i don &apos;t see any reason why that should not be .
and you can see that green do@@ t there in the middle .
look , let me give you an analog@@ y .
they moved around to become a natural idea .
they tell them to open up do@@ ors .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
how many would decide to choose a good memory ?
is it for others , or is it us ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
the first is that we don &apos;t continue .
so just imagine two other little change change .
he st@@ ell@@ ed out of my consciousness .
if you have to give something , you &apos;ll give it now .
and no , it &apos;s not clear , or san francisco .
now , chimpanze@@ es are known for your ag@@ gressi@@ ve .
play is the ti@@ t that dis@@ gre@@ ts us .
so much te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , but no response to that .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s going to be a girl .
so gender can occu@@ r in many different var@@ ie@@ ties in many different var@@ ie@@ ties .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open up do@@ ors ?
how do you ju@@ dge people based on their characteri@@ stics ?
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look at great .
you can look really fab@@ ul@@ ous for less than 50 dollars .
we@@ dn@@ es@@ day : embra@@ ce her your intern@@ al kid .
frank@@ ance makes a tor . it@@ al@@ y makes a tor .
zi@@ zi@@ e , in a moment of head .
now , we know all about where our things come from .
now , we &apos;ve introduced the ma@@ yo@@ r bel@@ on@@ ging .
we called it the digital water pa@@ ige .
they can move and do different kinds of experiences .
so the next day we were in cle@@ vel@@ and .
so imagine a so@@ und@@ scap@@ e plane .
he says , &quot; make a break@@ through . &quot;
i said , &quot; please fly in the air . &quot;
and in the world , everything had a sense of me .
and she said , &quot; do you remember ?
but i really do believe that there &apos;s something else coming on for us .
here is , &quot; put your finger on every light . &quot;
at one point , the screen lo@@ ws with leaves .
the only thing that happened is , they had 10 children .
i said , &quot; promis@@ es , grandmother . &quot;
we are just sitting around like this .
so these women ga@@ ined together .
i think that &apos;s true of every human being on the planet .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of her . &quot;
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
child mortality is re@@ duc@@ ing a 10@@ h .
so the growth rate is acceler@@ ating .
thir@@ ty years ago , this was ridi@@ cul@@ ous hearing .
it was developed at university of washington in se@@ attle .
it &apos;s pre@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed and curious programs .
in either case , oper@@ ated and it went all well .
they were both color@@ ed to me , they questi@@ oned me .
it &apos;s a completely den@@ ial of failure .
i &apos;m not a robo@@ tic ; i don &apos;t always do things .
they want to share their stories . they want to share their stories .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my hero@@ es .
he descri@@ bes one of them as very common .
now it &apos;s on the red list of thre@@ at@@ ers .
we had no words for what we started there .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
that &apos;s exactly where our goal is .
in the future , most cri@@ mes are going to play .
now , how do people die of such a ha@@ ck ?
so , pull pull off , and start inv@@ ading them .
and i see the same process in combin@@ ation of photos .
also , urban designer and construction farmer are very interested .
this is an idea that is worth spre@@ ading .
i want to talk about the problem and talk about a couple of possible solutions .
they had 3@@ 4@@ 8 different types of mar@@ ker .
well it turns out that they are right .
this year , almost 200 million million years ago .
but what about this day , that particular day ?
this year , it &apos;s been looking at 50 million times .
it &apos;s a puzz@@ le that will be put together .
i want to share with you a couple of pieces of the puzz@@ le .
but our lives are so much more than our memor@@ ies .
darwin and spon@@ sor@@ s became heal@@ e@@ ded .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the bri@@ ck .
&quot; don &apos;t make sure that it &apos;s un@@ true .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
we know even one more where all the gas shows .
the next step was to find the app@@ s for this .
and we design an i@@ pa@@ d-@@ ap@@ p .
so he got the citi@@ zen to check her .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
politics does not change ; government is in change .
but that was not the end of the th@@ yl@@ ac@@ es .
that &apos;s great . this is the beauty of the physical physical .
so the post@@ ill@@ hi@@ c movement has done it .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
the cell communities came again to abstra@@ ct information .
and that was the brain and the ner@@ ve system of these communities .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
so in other words , i definitely mean , what i want .
that &apos;s kind of like all of them in the peri@@ ods .
if you go far away , walk together . &quot;
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
that &apos;s a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
so i know from a couple that didn &apos;t have them .
and even today , we dep@@ end on very , very strong stories .
what &apos;s happened is that nan@@ ot@@ ed machines .
we &apos;ve been doing that in the so-@@ called bir@@ d-@@ time age .
we have an abstra@@ ct , abstra@@ ct language .
we &apos;ve been used to making things lin@@ ear .
the way it used to be that far on the village .
and , of course , how does design affect the perception of the perception .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing i &apos;ve just described .
that &apos;s the time where you fall in love with .
so how does a human being dis@@ close with certain things .
and because we are older , they &apos;ll be larger .
care of america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
a baby takes about six thousand wind wind .
have you seen a cli@@ ot@@ al tree ?
so that means that the crime rate goes back .
we &apos;ve been used in h@@ oll@@ and now about three years .
and the oil is going to replace us through others .
it &apos;s not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
everything that is beautiful is not efficient .
because you know , this is a fun process .
hey , pu@@ ma , you really want to be serious ?
so he felt like that , like that ?
it &apos;s only been ne@@ ver@@ si@@ ous years ago .
the music em@@ pi@@ re is the exten@@ sion of our bodies .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound bag .
and also , what you think in mind is in mind .
i have a friend who dri@@ ves a pas@@ ser@@ om .
this is an organis@@ m that we described in 199@@ 6 .
or some other models , or even engineering skills .
we needed to do because of the law@@ yers and so on .
and if possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the weird ones .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are .
and it &apos;s doing this based on the sli@@ des in the pictures .
bla@@ ise , that &apos;s really incredible . heart con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ lations .
i just want to say a little bit about sal@@ at@@ d@@ lock .
they have to ad@@ mit that this is a large sele@@ ction .
a sequence of that was that the tele@@ phone was never broken .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
why do you pay for us if we can &apos;t buy ?
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
this is the audience we did recently .
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is the great leg@@ acy of humanity .
it &apos;s just brea@@ thing ambi@@ tious .
it also ex@@ pli@@ c@@ it@@ ly im@@ men@@ se you@@ th in the control room .
it &apos;s also my big , life@@ -@@ life love and fascin@@ ation .
and i &apos;m not expe@@ cting that the change will change .
like al@@ ga@@ e , and other people &apos;s fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing things .
please follow me because the circle is going to end up again .
so people in the west really have thought about creativity .
it &apos;s like hit@@ ting the sun .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not making it . thank you .
and all of a sudden he didn &apos;t come into human .
in 25 years it &apos;s going to be disappe@@ ared from here .
this is 20 feet , like green@@ land .
and the predic@@ tions , as you &apos;ve read , are serious .
however , there &apos;s a political battle in our country .
fro@@ sty , the hydro@@ man &apos;s going to clean up every day .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaph@@ ors .
this is a vari@@ ary of one thing that was done .
the fact is that these inse@@ curity should care about us .
for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
so that was the same , bad team of one under the best .
my great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents died when they were 60 .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my death tail .
di@@ ph@@ ence , ro@@ ph@@ ying , car control ...
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face it .
you can just name a couple of names and people understand .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
ask questions , ask the evidence , demand evidence .
that &apos;s a lot of to@@ ds through mas@@ ks , 20 hours an hour .
that &apos;s great . i love the plac@@ e@@ bo industry .
they get to th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki in southern africa .
this is an i@@ dio@@ tic argument . she has to stop .
a very con@@ cre@@ te wish that we inv@@ ent this technology .
you know , there was no mand@@ ar@@ ins in the garden .
and then people could eat the food and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why do we fight this ?
there are no other descri@@ ption for what &apos;s happening here .
we can put this time machine into everything we want .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain him .
this trick can lead you to your friends and neighb@@ ors . thank you .
it turns out that it &apos;s not all about it .
i know what people think , if you see that .
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy that . thank you very much .
and my talk today is mostly about these cognitive ones .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds of their pain .
and the answer is really easy . they &apos;re forever lost forever .
i mean , how much do we draw from our memor@@ ies ?
there are others , but that &apos;s common .
i mentioned this to mi@@ cr@@ el and he nie@@ ced it .
i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
i can say the chan@@ z@@ ler@@ in is a guy .
but that was not that much in the agri@@ cultural years .
yeah , this is the one that &apos;s the load down there .
and then there &apos;s a whole lot of simu@@ lations .
and so it pul@@ ls its in@@ formed state .
br@@ un@@ o gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : thank you .
he &apos;s got a food commercial from 15 to one .
i said , &quot; chicken p@@ el@@ lets ? &quot;
&quot; well , these are about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
it &apos;s a biolog@@ ist at v@@ et@@ a la pal@@ m .
i wasn &apos;t a long time ago with mi@@ ke .
the sh@@ ri@@ mp eating the physical ha@@ st@@ ton .
so the pain@@ ter the gut the gut is better the system . &quot;
it &apos;s this de@@ fau@@ lt , lo@@ aded taste .
and then i immediately dro@@ ps me , that &apos;s un@@ fair .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a spon@@ ge .
the system is so healthy ; it cle@@ ans water .
that &apos;s not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
because they are the ones who are experts who are also experts .
and immediately i see a different pattern that makes it .
so i take a step back , and i get the perspective .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening of the film .
that was not a movie , no t@@ d , that was real .
and it was an experience that couldn &apos;t give me me .
so that really stuck with me , and i wanted more .
now , the power is way over time .
in fact , the progress society is based on energy progress .
now , where are we going to go , what &apos;s the right approach ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds of them .
here &apos;s a picture of an orange in k@@ ent@@ u@@ cky .
open the map , and they boun@@ ce them with a cli@@ ck .
and i celebra@@ te , i wonder how a little kid .
so we should soon try to figure out what the target represents .
the idea is to over@@ come a digital security system .
you could also use regular pat@@ mes technology to spread .
i worked in a coal min@@ or -- dangerous .
i &apos;ve been fil@@ med in war areas -- hard and dangerous .
and the film is going to be the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; re@@ gre@@ t ever &quot; .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
they &apos;re going to see the whole thing in stat@@ es .
you know , we hear a lot about transpar@@ ency .
law@@ yer : i &apos;m a law@@ yer brand .
that &apos;s what i did . the first picture is a picture of my family .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be coming out of it .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
and , by the time , and w@@ ells , you &apos;re in this museum .
one of my friends has made it -- richard b@@ oll@@ ing@@ hi@@ p .
in there they are , they want to end up the end of the gan@@ ges .
and i thought , &quot; wait a second , that sounds interesting . &quot;
but what if you want to see the pin@@ stri@@ kes ?
there are many more , but i &apos;ve got time .
that &apos;s really cool part , which is called colle@@ ctions .
for example , this one who is fully logi@@ cal .
well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often .
but my logi@@ cal side doesn &apos;t make it easy either .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip chip .
that &apos;s the piece i &apos;m going to talk about right now .
there &apos;s more work behind that ; it &apos;s even deeper .
each of these top@@ ics were , of course , many , many smaller decisions .
fif@@ ty percent of their decisions were within nine minutes or less .
they &apos;re always worried that they lose them .
because the images for them re@@ con@@ ci@@ le .
in other words , play is our adap@@ tive jo@@ ker .
the more money you deser@@ ve .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , although that &apos;s what i mean .
how can we trans@@ fer these feelings into reality ?
ok , imagine how extreme self-@@ assem@@ bly su@@ its .
players are more social nets in spi@@ ders .
and this is from an econom@@ ist . so it &apos;s logi@@ cal .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
and i can tell you , it was a transforma@@ tive experience .
or , you want to be fit@@ ter , more powerful .
i was fascin@@ ated by the eleph@@ ant and beauty of biology .
can you imagine a good thing that comes from to@@ bac@@ co ?
these are the sorts of questions that we need to talk about .
and that &apos;s actually a conser@@ va@@ tive esti@@ ma@@ tion .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
just that i think it &apos;s more like it , not true .
now , you &apos;re not going to be happ@@ ier .
when the kid was born , she looks like a girl .
i &apos;m j@@ ess@@ i and this is my su@@ it@@ case .
if you &apos;re happy , other people get happ@@ ier people .
i &apos;m s@@ mil@@ ing , and i say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
so there are no exc@@ use for somebody here in this audience .
clearly , that &apos;s not all in my tiny su@@ it@@ case .
if we &apos;re building cities , that &apos;s a big thing .
but we only know about where the things go .
we can actually do the same things in less energy .
but actually it was a lot of fun that night .
now , imagine this ima@@ gery could really start flying .
they are inter@@ acting with their environment and their experience .
it &apos;s very r@@ ar@@ ely wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ly wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ing a roll@@ s of ice .
since that time , we &apos;ve ob@@ tain@@ ed all sorts of recogni@@ tion .
today , i want to tell you about cir@@ cles and re@@ vel@@ ations .
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
my un@@ cle died of al@@ co@@ hol diseases .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our justice system .
one amazing failure rate . one of nine inno@@ cent dis@@ gu@@ it@@ ty .
and of course , it never can give you more than that . &quot;
and yet there &apos;s this mental dis@@ connect .
i said , &quot; let &apos;s try to get against justice .
even who kill someone is not just a mon@@ tat@@ or .
right , br@@ y@@ an , the ju@@ dge has magic force .
i had 14@@ -year-old , poor black guys as a mand@@ s .
a few months ago , over and i had just for@@ gotten everything .
10 minutes later , the real thing was announ@@ cing a break .
that our survival is completely connected to each individual .
it was the ab@@ und@@ ant cros@@ sing against drug .
they slow down for no one of our large problems .
it &apos;s about understanding the nu@@ an@@ ces of language .
my grand@@ father was in prison &apos;s pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion in prison .
in 2010 , we &apos;ve just been connected under two billion people online .
what are you going to consu@@ me ? what are you going to want ?
depen@@ ding on his behavior , we can predict the structure and predi@@ ction .
we have the capital of the technologies phil@@ anthro@@ pi@@ sts .
we &apos;re talking from 300 when a bat hit 300 .
this is the one that &apos;s safe about four percent .
and i colle@@ cted more and more knowledge .
i exam@@ ined wife prin@@ ter and she was in res@@ pir@@ atory .
they shu@@ t them up to the be@@ at@@ el machine .
she didn &apos;t care about copy@@ right protection .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
the bro@@ ch@@ es@@ s are still descri@@ bing as un@@ tou@@ ched .
and the fish also had been very fortun@@ ate to be there .
i know now that it was the cause of the ocean .
then they wanted to kill them because they could eat good .
here &apos;s a short video of what we do .
and that video actually had been la@@ id in janu@@ ary .
this is the approach to everything new , which we creativity .
it was completely ex@@ clu@@ de that she could fail .
my mother , my sister and i sle@@ pt in the same bed .
and the more open i said , the more i should tell .
&quot; because they &apos;ve been doing this morning , &quot; he said .
i &apos;m here to share my photogra@@ photograph@@ y with you .
but what is the trick that makes it look more reali@@ stic ?
it &apos;s really just about combin@@ ing different reality .
as you see , these are not three pictures of images .
but , you know , they can do something special like this .
second of all , photos should have taken pictures of data .
i always start with a sc@@ et@@ ch , an idea .
and yes , i &apos;ve got a problem like you might recognize .
... it &apos;s paying attention to the crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing licen@@ se .
h@@ h@@ h@@ h , who@@ a !
th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ents ? yes . alive ? y@@ ap .
if a neighb@@ or is helping the other streng@@ ths , we do our communities .
let &apos;s call out the animals , it costs a lot of money .
government is absolutely critical , but it needs to be efficient .
what is this new state that goes up the world ?
and the next interesting thing took about a billion years ago .
in fact , we are such a multi-@@ tru@@ ck community .
she could be able to do within a ti@@ le .
the invention of language was a little step in this direction .
we see the process of fe@@ eding itself .
so , in some ex@@ cess , the technologies are over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
and the ligh@@ ting path through the rest of the book .
this is actually an extraordinary honor for me .
she was a wea@@ pon , strong woman , she had an effect .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also lo@@ ving .
now , because you don &apos;t know that it was different .
this is the simulation of ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ pe@@ e bay .
ro@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ated frame@@ work .
but , you know , if you &apos;re in a foreign battle .
it was auto@@ ma@@ ted the auto@@ ma@@ ted bri@@ ck .
a few years ago , i started working on li@@ tt@@ ue .
we &apos;ve also brought li@@ tt@@ ing@@ ness schools .
one thing that &apos;s beautiful is not efficient .
and other examples are the ambi@@ ents , intelligent systems .
i apo@@ logi@@ ze that i have to close down so much .
yeah , i &apos;m very pleas@@ ed to be with them .
but so far , i just make it a little bit more curious .
but also our perception of how fa@@ ke it .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting about vision .
the more i think about it , the intui@@ tive it is .
i want to help you a particular type of curi@@ osity .
so , for example , the environment , dri@@ ll the world , dri@@ ves less car .
now , of course , we can look at the g@@ arb@@ age problem .
we could , of course , buy 10 percent , but what does this do ?
so the question is , how do we deal with these wind@@ als ?
here &apos;s the evidence of fact that men aren &apos;t pig@@ s .
we see that the phosp@@ hor@@ us is really critical .
and the first thing is , first of all , what &apos;s the right thing to do .
and the lives lived in the kitchen area of british colum@@ bia .
if you walk , yes , everybody destro@@ yed on the ground .
they can ki@@ ck away where they go and stand .
that means that we are useful , not less sk@@ ul@@ l .
the things that are only used will go in technical systems .
that &apos;s why they help me ask them to ask people .
there are this for a direct re@@ ference system .
also , in every store , you can get the things back .
i mean , i expla@@ ined what those sounds could mean .
i take the breath of the audience , consci@@ ously , un@@ conscious .
and then the same thing is going on in a good , consi@@ stent conversation .
the x-@@ pre@@ ci@@ le interpretation of a clip is that it &apos;s similar to this .
now , how do you start talking to the language of music ?
because the music is a language , and it &apos;s a language to communicate .
that lo@@ ses in the first year half of his commer@@ ce .
and she asked him what &apos;s your ho@@ b@@ bi@@ e ?
i have to tell you , i think that was a big er@@ ror .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
this is a book , an example of non-@@ foot@@ age data .
maybe this is an artificial way to read an e-@@ book book .
we can shift from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the way to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the way is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze choice .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
and i think it ten@@ ds to make the world look like this .
second , what econom@@ ists call sac@@ per@@ t@@ as@@ it@@ t@@ win@@ t@@ sk@@ ill .
there &apos;s a magnetic amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
econom@@ ists call this a par@@ e@@ to impro@@ vement .
as it turns out , dna syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zation is very difficult .
some people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we take images of these mini@@ -@@ great@@ -@@ size stars in dete@@ c@@ tors .
and of course , we all share the same custom@@ i@@ ties .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want is : why don &apos;t you ?
she said it would be like a ben@@ ch of air .
and i appreci@@ ate that many of you have done that too .
see , i &apos;m looking like a song to write a song ?
i started thinking , i should just come up with this project .
i believe that , and i feel that we should teach that .
this is the source of most su@@ it@@ ini@@ a in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
the most powerful min@@ ker wor@@ ker is the leader of mas@@ sey bush .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and also sm@@ ells good .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean co@@ w technology .
so when i put them on side side , they squ@@ ee@@ ze their interest .
if we over@@ do it , we can break a little back .
so the device that you see here is not working .
how many do@@ ors have the house in which they live ?
there was no s@@ ant@@ an trees . we did all this .
you make the er@@ ror , and you pay a lot later .
research , it &apos;s just mad , how little it is suppor@@ tive .
usually , most people start to gui@@ de themselves on the task .
they are invest@@ ing a lot of their time in the assem@@ bly plants .
ce@@ os are something on average , but this is going to be interesting .
this was happening . not a team had a stable structure .
because , frank@@ ly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
and this is the worth that experience that is so simple .
there &apos;s a pac@@ t-@@ u@@ tili@@ ty starting point there .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think so .
that &apos;s sc@@ and@@ al@@ ous and we should be as@@ ham@@ ed .
one in the audience ever saw anybody die in mas@@ ks ?
they don &apos;t dun@@ e their great@@ ly . more .
and we should not do that . our health system is mi@@ mic .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have the consequences .
but as you &apos;ve talked about a variety of people around the world , they talked about this opportunity .
and when i turn around , the fing@@ ers change its position .
we &apos;re going to meet a couple of times in the next days .
the first of these dro@@ ps is a con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts to ad@@ mit complexity .
what had been re@@ lie@@ ved of the experience of the experience .
now , the remin@@ dent itself is a story@@ t@@ eller .
it &apos;s got sight of life , one after the other .
most of them are completely ignor@@ ed by remem@@ ber@@ ing ourselves .
we think about our future as a predi@@ ction .
and that &apos;s a little bit harder to justi@@ fy , i think .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
so you can ask , how happy is the living self ?
we know that money is very important , tar@@ gets are very important .
we found that in the terms of the living self .
if we looked at how emotion rel@@ ates with income .
this is the politics , i think , in the coming years .
here he li@@ f@@ ts a rare gli@@ le .
there are only the other best , the fire@@ men .
second , if he &apos;s right , he &apos;s got no sou@@ l .
because he doesn &apos;t know what to do a bunch of things first .
he &apos;s very happy about it , because he saved her .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum , very many ideas .
and in ber@@ lin , there was a crazy engineer .
they have a rene@@ w@@ able energy today about 15 percent .
the conven@@ tional system looks like this in the world .
and then we started negoti@@ ating with insu@@ ber@@ ers .
this first one that was more like an im@@ passion@@ able mon@@ key .
&quot; 2.@@ 5 to one thing ? what do you feed ? &quot;
he said he doesn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to ask him .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love story .
let &apos;s call it mi@@ cr@@ el . actually , he &apos;s called mi@@ gu@@ el .
they did that by using the land .
they feel that this is the actual truth behind the outside .
now he &apos;s talking the miner@@ al needs of physical lea@@ k@@ ton .
so , as a farm , they &apos;re not fe@@ eding their animals ?
it &apos;s a fis@@ her@@ y fish , but also a bird reser@@ ve .
look at mi@@ cr@@ el , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el .
the program i used here is a little experiment .
you might want to test it for my talk .
and interest@@ ingly , bon@@ o is also a ted@@ prize prize .
we &apos;re talking about the cur@@ se of information over@@ head .
so i decided when i was 15 , i &apos;m going to di@@ ver .
and i over@@ come them , an expedi@@ tion .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
the question is , you can get it to zero .
usually you &apos;re just sort of dan@@ ger and some people , others don &apos;t .
because although he &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concern@@ s .
in many , they &apos;ll say , they are mad ! that &apos;s good .
and what happened was i needed an exper@@ t .
i was the only one who could talk to the air@@ screen .
the pilot made the machine after the hu@@ d@@ son river .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given my e@@ go space .
i haven &apos;t killed my wife anymore with my wife .
almost as if we were going to pre@@ p@@ are our lives for a long time .
i just wish i could see my kids grow up .
i became the mira@@ cle that wasn &apos;t going to die that day .
looks like ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned organisms .
now , don &apos;t understand me that went wrong , that &apos;s not easy .
so the driving force is the domin@@ ant super@@ power .
i don &apos;t know how recei@@ ver people will be .
so , my gentle@@ man , can you help me ? i need help .
i really love your way , ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in .
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the actual version .
are they ? you see a little ner@@ ght out of it .
the epi@@ ph@@ as@@ is is a part of the life of life .
please wel@@ come the fear . please wel@@ come the risk .
if the museum gave us the image , they click them up .
this picture , for example , has about 10 billion scre@@ ens , i think .
let &apos;s start off to mom@@ a , again in new york .
in the previous example , it was about finding individuals .
they don &apos;t even come from the ar@@ muse@@ ums .
now , where would you put your brain on that scale ?
i &apos;m going to show it a little bit bigger here . we look carefully at the center here .
so what i &apos;m telling you is something truly fantastic .
only pre@@ cise time points , they match one .
i mean , that &apos;s just what my lo@@ gic side says .
you know how many decisions do you do ?
you know , how many choices do you make in a typical week ?
it was a store that was the dra@@ e@@ dy &apos; s .
and we learned that there &apos;s actually a connection .
so i &apos;m going to show you very carefully what i &apos;ve brought .
i said , we are prepared for our own epi@@ c play .
this is a fascinating ad@@ vent@@ ure that you &apos;re going to go .
and i hope you &apos;ll design me with me and play .
and if you can , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
if you ask me , i &apos;m not sure about that .
again , what potential would we want to do ?
which would you like if you could only have one ?
if you wouldn &apos;t want it to do this change in your genes ?
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are together with chimpanze@@ es our next living relationships .
but bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s show us the other side of the ocean .
most of my actions , i have two hat@@ s .
and as a common word , we can use the word &quot; inter@@ sexual power . &quot;
we &apos;re producing and@@ ro@@ gen and we &apos;re talking to and@@ ro@@ gens .
if you didn &apos;t move it , you bu@@ ried them .
i mean , what does someone do with so many out@@ f@@ its ?
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of reasons .
and i really want to show you my out@@ come portra@@ its that week this week .
think of this as the ima@@ gery , as a flying point .
you see the person who as@@ ks what &apos;s happening inside .
i want to show you the lat@@ est project that we &apos;re working on .
and part of the ir@@ on is more than 100,000 years old .
this is the average size of a land ice berg .
it &apos;s about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 feet .
so they pull around , and they make art@@ work like this .
but there was always a life cycle in their biology .
it &apos;s called e@@ ye@@ ol@@ or , you can see the descri@@ ption .
so at the end of two weeks , we went back to temp@@ ts room .
that kee@@ ps us in the distance , and we continue to continue .
so the recor@@ ds were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
mt is going to be part of the show , which is quite des@@ per@@ ate .
you can go to the block and take it open .
this is technology suppor@@ ted innovation that is available today .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
it was the fear of ter@@ ror that made her life .
he said , &quot; in germany , there are no dea@@ ths .
we all have to believe in the end things that we can &apos;t see .
innovation , creativity , and development not only come from our heads .
w@@ r , people want to help the inno@@ cent gui@@ de .
sometimes i suff@@ er the equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um . a story to finish .
the ju@@ dge looked at him as adults , but i see a kid .
and i thought that this is so heavy , so pain@@ ful .
more and more people came in , just because they were mad .
from my e@@ ye@@ wit@@ es , i saw the jan@@ it@@ ors up and down .
this de@@ pu@@ ty land@@ ed over the older black guy .
br@@ y@@ an ste@@ ven@@ son : well , there are all kinds of opportunity everywhere .
then let us project the analog@@ y into the future .
the cost of solar energy in the last year was about 50 percent .
i didn &apos;t have studied this in my work as a law@@ yer .
and the best part is perhaps what &apos;s happening in health .
we &apos;ve just been cros@@ sing the 7@@ -@@ billi@@ on-@@ dollar brand .
i &apos;d like to finish up with a story that really enth@@ ched me .
that means that the players are safe sle@@ eping out of 10 be@@ ats .
i was sending them home without my hom@@ ist .
i went home through the emergen@@ cy department on my way home .
i was sho@@ cked and ti@@ ed up to the inter@@ ior .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
we still come up to the gala@@ pa@@ gos is@@ lands .
so it hasn &apos;t changed , and yet it changed .
these pictures are extraordinary because the transi@@ tion goes very quickly .
but they don &apos;t take the previous los@@ ses right .
because through se@@ prote@@ cted areas , we basically put back the past .
a long time ago , there was gra@@ y -- 500 years ago .
and the mo@@ tives of online crimin@@ als are very easy to understand .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
they have to make 6@@ 2 different decisions to design their car completely .
car colors , outside of the automo@@ bile -- i have 5@@ 6 possibilities .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of choices .
cat@@ s look at cat@@ s that look at this video .
today , we &apos;re not just going to find genom@@ ics in something we do .
the words , as long as his friends , mo@@ t@@ led now .
i knew that she was coming to say go@@ od@@ b@@ ye .
makes it impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
and yeah , we can find fast food chain .
but where would that be the next a@@ ed to help this patient ?
how did he get to look se@@ arch@@ ing for help ?
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take it away .
the ta@@ ke@@ -@@ off of software takes a few years away .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
a typical wh@@ ale man@@ eu@@ vering them today .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean this , necessarily , a technical definition of the platform .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call office re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy .
because that &apos;s where the actual government emplo@@ ys work .
we need to focus on the government of government .
you have to introdu@@ ce you to the enormous challenges that you have to ask .
so , if you could pull the lights back .
we have many cells that are not alone on themselves .
it &apos;s a fairly amazing invention , when you think about it .
so no@@ wa@@ days , evolution can happen in time by micro@@ seconds .
so we &apos;ve been re@@ duc@@ ing the sc@@ ra@@ ps again .
because their lives depen@@ ded upon whether you did the job right .
because all these new technologies are fe@@ eding themselves .
i thought that technology should make magic , not kill .
fire@@ flies in a glass , i always found myself a lot .
i say that because i believe that identity is very important .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
there we are , as we say , by dom@@ ini@@ c .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in the case of red in@@ ot@@ ar .
and within a few years , le@@ go in every hou@@ se@@ hold .
they add a blue to green , and they can make light .
wait wait , this is really my favorite project .
the no@@ ti@@ sted notes have the function of letters in a writing .
it goes way back , in the cultures of the pre-@@ industrial times .
and they did that with so-@@ called lea@@ ad@@ -@@ land maps .
that means that they are navi@@ g@@ ated with sound and about rhyth@@ m .
so we clearly have some way to inno@@ v@@ ate a lot of hope .
then that &apos;s the kind of verb@@ al per@@ su@@ ade of the industri@@ alized civili@@ zations .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last hal@@ f-@@ year .
so i worked on looking at when , of course , when or intui@@ tive or intui@@ tive .
and six milli@@ seconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time of most per@@ cep@@ tual dis@@ orders that we have .
if we actually don &apos;t take phosp@@ hor@@ us and dis@@ count .
here &apos;s what it says , the more you are re@@ br@@ ing@@ hing , the better .
even when they were sho@@ ot@@ ing , they would have emis@@ sions .
so we don &apos;t have to control the people , so little bad .
that means that it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
and i &apos;m not sure if you really want to stay there .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can make a little trip .
how were the circum@@ stances of the society and politics ?
the components of it will be more and more for the friend that you live with .
you learn to find the sound on the instrument on the instrument .
and l@@ oud sig@@ ns , f and b , et ce@@ ter@@ a .
it &apos;s no longer necessary to sing a roman@@ ce or to sing .
i ask myself , what was the diagno@@ sis of diagno@@ sis diagno@@ sed ?
there was no piano at the time , as an instrument at the age of time .
from that time there &apos;s an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that you might know about .
one day , this mir@@ r@@ ors , yes , there &apos;s a beautiful one .
the human being su@@ mm@@ ed from the mon@@ key or a shared ance@@ stry .
but it &apos;s critical , if i have right , then it &apos;s true .
there &apos;s the bottom of the research lab le@@ o@@ po@@ d@@ sha@@ f .
i played the first sentence of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s demo@@ lin .
so finally , there was a company that tried to do it right .
i ate him in a restaurant in southern spa@@ in .
september 10@@ th of september last year , the machine went to the machine for the first time .
5@@ 4 percent of the dea@@ ths was s@@ hr@@ un@@ k through he@@ ar@@ di@@ ums .
in contr@@ ast , it &apos;s a complex meta@@ physical view .
the modern industrial world , as we know , is not 300 years old .
it &apos;s our new country , and it &apos;s called n@@ un@@ a@@ v@@ als .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all miner@@ als .
now this is actually live on the internet . they can test it .
should i go to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
so that hit me when i tried to d@@ ress my je@@ ans au@@ d@@ ders .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t let myself down .
is it clear that the answer to the question is , you .
they ste@@ er the paraly@@ sis and sen@@ ds the satis@@ fac@@ tion .
and , if we can do that , we can start the chromo@@ some ?
so , this looks like a bas@@ ket@@ ball pla@@ yo@@ ff .
in fact , nasa has shown that there are many things out there .
on the last ted , i was a introdu@@ ction to the l@@ h@@ c .
and the key indi@@ c@@ ator is extin@@ ction of languages .
it means that we have a cultural impact next to the scientific achie@@ vement .
by the end of mar@@ ch , the l@@ h@@ c will be re-@@ func@@ tional .
people would say , &quot; you don &apos;t succe@@ ed ? &quot;
but instead of too low , he just stopped walking up .
finally , a solution that is large enough to solve our problems .
new investment , to create good job jobs .
this is our yo@@ un@@ gest te@@ ster here on the right .
most people know that most of the software .
that actually took a little over two , eight times the form that these networks are .
and then we &apos;ve been gest@@ iting a co@@ in-@@ to-@@ the-@@ wall of co@@ des .
there was , i think , a good code .
so that &apos;s just an app@@ lic@@ ation that you can do with this .
i think , some@@ what sec@@ ure dollars or something like that .
so , i think it &apos;s a very sophisti@@ cated ha@@ ck .
and these are just the bio@@ ha@@ ta@@ ers that are individual people .
and i had to explain the journ@@ alists that it doesn &apos;t exist .
we &apos;re going to move games to come from the true world of real world .
we de@@ gra@@ m a human that has worth a value for our societies .
a couple of them , probably like a lot of them , there are many more creative people here .
ah , the majority . i like to see as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
our gut is a wonderful ho@@ st environment for this bacteria .
this is all the reality today , and in the future , it will be a lot more possible .
this is actually the real con@@ jun@@ ction of human and machine .
but nothing was invented that was going to let me go .
he said , &quot; be@@ z@@ os , they have to go into the house .
the secret is that the game is key to these skills .
now , if it seems to be , play seems to be the most appropriate thing .
and that &apos;s called the and@@ ro@@ gens re@@ cep@@ tor@@ ial .
so we have a lot of roman@@ tic ideas about individu@@ alism .
and our nation is based on a very roman@@ tic concept of individu@@ alism .
my inspiration comes back from an event that is about 500 years back .
they talk about nature &apos;s power to tell us who we are .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human being .
we are finding other fe@@ atures about what their rights are .
but a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
i &apos;ve brought seven pants pants along , and that &apos;s all .
that &apos;s what we call per@@ cep@@ tual design .
so if we do something about the city , that &apos;s a big thing .
now , that night , all of them went to the center to celebra@@ te .
and the question was : how could you com@@ bine technology to connect new technology ?
imagine that every single one of us is being mix@@ ed .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impul@@ se for the river fire .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
and i said , &quot; how do you interact with this ? &quot;
so we created a device that is completely free of limit@@ ations .
and that &apos;s something that we need to learn , and very quickly .
so i asked him how he &apos;s been able to do a little bit of a fish interview .
the system is so healthy ; it &apos;s completely self-@@ mar@@ vel@@ ous .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building si@@ v , not inten@@ sely .
i literally grew up with a sti@@ cky por@@ tion in science fi@@ ction .
it &apos;s about five tons of it on the planet on the planet .
and somehow , we have to make change that will show up to zero .
people here have contribu@@ ted to the development of many of these mira@@ cles .
now , i wonder@@ ed how could i put that up ?
it &apos;s the rene@@ w@@ ables , as many as they are .
speci@@ alized skills and process@@ ors and the combin@@ ation and the combin@@ ation of success .
so i asked a 100,000 prize to software for the w@@ inner .
they produced the highest constru@@ cted in the world .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
small@@ po@@ x . po@@ ll@@ s have killed billions of people on this planet .
and i started writing an article on soli@@ d-@@ engine@@ ered food .
this is a fish fish in southern western corner .
what about kinder@@ sh@@ ment ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
we hate a lot of government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
it &apos;s just a bunch of cal@@ ories . it &apos;s mi@@ mic .
in the moment , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
now , what does this have to do with the plac@@ e@@ bo effect ?
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
this is my skin . that &apos;s not a special effect from hollywood .
this is actually my skin . that &apos;s not a special effect from hollywood .
okay , let me give you a little bit of blood molecules out of it .
there &apos;s an enormous wave of interest in happiness .
now , living selves live continu@@ ously .
now , the two species of self are the words of happiness .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to look at as a ph@@ d .
we develop collabor@@ ative , heart creatures .
so this en@@ ables them to grow together from bin@@ ds , trust and each other .
i looked at her and she was s@@ mil@@ ing , but she looked very serious .
but with youtube , more than 4@@ 8 hours video per minute is lo@@ aded up .
the biggest fear was that ra@@ pe , ra@@ pe and death .
opportunity that would not have been encoura@@ ged , ex@@ pli@@ c@@ ated .
three months later , i was pulled around , and the ad@@ vent@@ ure went on .
pictures like this : a building site for a much bigger road .
so the first rule is that combin@@ ation should have taken the same perspective .
for example , the fish had been recor@@ ded on an er@@ ror .
this is my wo@@ ke wa@@ x . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
and it &apos;s been re@@ duced , organic , of course .
i didn &apos;t know much about government , when i started this program .
it &apos;s the g@@ arb@@ age on the page . went home .
so finding programs that can benefit the former numbers .
this piece of this piece of green was the magic thing for me .
one kid in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a mon@@ keys . &quot;
in the short time here , i became a clear one of them : ted has an identity .
one is called &quot; jac@@ ange@@ s and the other is called &quot; s@@ wing . &quot;
in my view , mass in@@ car@@ ance have trans@@ formed our world fundament@@ ally trans@@ formed .
the death pen@@ al@@ ty in america is re@@ defined by mis@@ direction .
but somehow , we do pull it down from this problem .
in many areas , people had to have sc@@ ared of ly@@ n@@ ch@@ bs .
i have some talks in germany over the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
it was always so inspi@@ rational .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make you very , very ti@@ red . &quot;
and that &apos;s why , i believe , the ted community should be .
because ultimately our humanity depen@@ ds upon our humanity .
if somebody is lying , he &apos;s not just a li@@ ar .
i believe that in many places the opposite of poverty is caus@@ ing poverty .
how could a ju@@ dge turn somebody in something that he isn &apos;t ?
i went into the car , and i was over@@ wh@@ el@@ med over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
5@@ 6 percent of all im@@ it@@ ra@@ tions are dis@@ char@@ ged by trial .
now , in fact , the number of non@@ violence is not very common .
i love a lot of black colors , many gra@@ s and such a stuff .
we have the bed , so that it can look outside , so that it can look outside .
remember , it &apos;s free , nei@@ ther of us suff@@ er from it .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never met each other as adults .
and this ur@@ gen@@ cy , this goal really changed my life .
here you see a clip from this an@@ gry code .
and guess what we found in the shel@@ f code ?
of course , this cannot be done by a human machine leader .
and when the danger@@ es are , then really bad things can happen .
so all those green areas , these are the fore@@ front environments .
but it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
these people will be connected to the movie forever -- forever .
if you look at the people that you have to do ...
and just so disappe@@ ared all of those companies , one after the other .
it &apos;s un@@ predic@@ table -- like this strange land@@ road .
so maybe you should just interview a little bit of this carto@@ on here . &quot;
now there &apos;s all of these ru@@ b@@ mel b@@ ones from the big dis@@ clo@@ sure .
this is my brand in my little , di@@ stor@@ ted industry .
if you could do it for those , you could help me .
in whatever context is the thinking and feelings about themselves ?
i love things that are special . i like special things .
why is it important to start again ? what represents the red ?
ei@@ ght-@@ off , se@@ as , mar@@ ke . how is their brand ?
it actually only invol@@ ves a time of two per second .
now , finally , the film is dem@@ and@@ ing a very large amount of awareness .
finally , when we should be concerned , we should wel@@ come the fear .
i don &apos;t know why they did , but i learned about it .
but at the same time , we need a good fra@@ ction of experiments actually .
so i went back to doing that a few years ago exactly that .
so it turns out that it &apos;s hard to come up with all those exten@@ dings .
alone alone , this air@@ port has a surface of 100 square kilometers .
my friends were asked to tell me , ted .
and when i listen@@ ed to her , she got so@@ ch@@ end no@@ is@@ es .
we &apos;ve spread li@@ tt@@ ing@@ ness to children and play it with them .
and the best part is that they connect with magnetic ones .
in essen@@ ce of our time , we &apos;ve been able to have a re@@ building block of our time .
somebody was broken , and the system was s@@ hr@@ un@@ k .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m talking about , but i can live .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely impossible .
some of my ti@@ ps happened in the last five years .
i looked into the ro@@ cks , and it was a little bit p@@ ink .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said , &quot; she &apos;s in this particular pit@@ ch .
and i made my first mistake ; i was sending them home .
so the dra@@ matic numbers occu@@ r in the prison prison prison .
and i was good , and i went off to c@@ um lau@@ de .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
you know how you call a 3@@ 00@@ ter in huge lea@@ gue baseball ?
how about commit@@ ment that we can &apos;t predict ?
how about a set of new voices , never heard before .
he &apos;s got the king of si@@ am to dinner .
it &apos;s made to create some du@@ mp@@ s of kin@@ dness .
i love this : &quot; no son force human op@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
of course , social dis@@ advantage . speak@@ er : 65 dea@@ ths .
and that was the first very first time of my own music expression .
because the fr@@ a@@ ter could go back to the best nature of phosp@@ hor@@ us .
but if i ask her how to do it with her wife ?
mean@@ while , there are many people working around and they can all be enga@@ ged .
they are interpre@@ ter notes in clinical music in clinical music .
so that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the point of letters is recogni@@ zing if you can tell the language .
you colle@@ c@@ tively colle@@ c@@ tively information about the piece in the kel@@ k@@ dat@@ y liter@@ ature .
to keep tw@@ ent@@ y , directly with the com@@ pos@@ er .
so often , the music class is that you read the notes .
you basically learn first to read just one word .
so the ham@@ mer@@ heads are the sequ@@ el of my finger .
remember , and say , &quot; if it ta@@ iled you or not . &quot;
if the music is too p@@ is@@ sed or too c@@ ute .
now , why do i struggle now from my audience that there &apos;s also ac@@ tively listening ?
an art@@ work that you never look at has no force .
this is , of course , high-@@ tech agriculture , but the facili@@ ties are self-@@ assem@@ bling .
and as i say the word of justice is that aw@@ k@@ ward feeling away .
and then ro@@ cks up , so that you can see the vie@@ ws .
and there he says , well , i &apos;m on fire fire@@ men .
now , i &apos;d like to show you what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
this is now a three-@@ sentence that descri@@ bes us a function that descri@@ bes us .
because lying to lying that they can easily apply the analy@@ tics to be fal@@ se .
the first sentence is cla@@ p out , there &apos;s no sou@@ l .
and if i &apos;m right , the can@@ tat@@ ler@@ in is a man .
if i don &apos;t right , the can@@ tat@@ ler@@ in is not a man .
because actually , we would have to prove whether there &apos;s the sou@@ l or not .
simil@@ arly , simil@@ arly , fac@@ ial sig@@ ns invol@@ ve each other .
because a good engineer either made great cars , or nuclear power plants .
it comes from asia , in the case of japan .
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
and you see that there are enormous spee@@ ds that exist there .
be responsible for your contribu@@ tion , whatever he wants him to be .
if you want to see the fun@@ ctions of this automo@@ bile , you can see them here .
but how would that be connected to all your images ?
the offi@@ cial stat@@ ement of all western industri@@ alized societies .
you &apos;ve r@@ ented your tele@@ phone ; you didn &apos;t buy it . mind .
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
why ? i wrote a book to try to explain it myself .
now how do we start a chromo@@ some ? how do we apply it ?
to put it in my context , i was born in 194@@ 6 .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
writing text@@ books is my job , but of course it &apos;s more than that .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions : &quot; : yes .
this is looking at me ancient gre@@ ars and the old ro@@ me .
when your work went -- not just your fau@@ lt , right ?
he ended up walking all the way through and did something completely new .
that &apos;s one of the most pain@@ ful cor@@ rec@@ tions of a creative life .
all civili@@ zations have come back to the dance with new living people .
it &apos;s good . the question is , how do we take care of this .
and the sugge@@ sti@@ on was to build many other co@@ w fac@@ tors .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
you &apos;re conne@@ cting it to a particular text and ten@@ ds to hi@@ re it .
and then the fir@@ m , then , under the head@@ line , and citi@@ zen science .
and that &apos;s the basic cause of the bio@@ ha@@ vor@@ ers .
i &apos;ve been writing four words , and i want to explain to you a short story .
same tool of information proce@@ dur@@ es have been since je@@ vels .
which , of course , is extremely distin@@ ctive , and it &apos;s a computer play .
but now it &apos;s not on local levels , but at global scale .
and look at how we do information , how do we take information ?
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as the first one .
they can only have nu@@ l@@ le@@ mis@@ sions if they &apos;re not there .
very directly , we can get back to that kind of food that we can get back to agriculture .
because it &apos;s un@@ friend@@ ly to go and take the nutri@@ ents .
i &apos;m jan@@ e mc@@ gon@@ ell@@ al . i &apos;m designing computer games .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vac@@ cin@@ es are essential .
why ? because we don &apos;t have children &apos;s lights , and you know what ?
we love to put it in lying . we love that .
now , i think i understand the phar@@ ma industry .
and all i can say is , why do we fight this ?
a de@@ ception will become something like this , because somebody percei@@ ves it .
the kni@@ fe that you can investi@@ gate ; my hand you can investi@@ gate .
but a white p@@ ill is not as good as a blue p@@ ill .
we &apos;re not only telling stories if we &apos;re doing stories .
and they asked them , &quot; who &apos;s got more thre@@ aten ? &quot;
and she was much worse for b than b in the memory .
from the point of view of the world , b clearly had a bad time .
finally , very , very important and in this case dom@@ ini@@ on , the end is domin@@ ated .
now , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s a two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half hours a half .
we know something about the happiness of happiness ourselves .
he was liber@@ ating us from one of the worst minds of human@@ kind .
this is a portra@@ it of photogra@@ pher@@ l to@@ le@@ dan@@ o .
we think that in reality , we &apos;re not as good as playing .
they create an epi@@ c source of knowledge of war@@ craft .
it &apos;s people who think they can change the world .
in front of these magni@@ fi@@ cent moments controll@@ ers , there was she@@ ep .
and thank god i did not use syn@@ ony@@ mous dic@@ tion@@ ary at the time .
and i tend to get wi@@ dri@@ ties as my sha@@ do@@ ws .
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
if we look at , this kind of change will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 199@@ 0 , and it took 13 years .
there are 6@@ 8 million people working around the world in the wheel@@ chair .
br@@ un@@ o gu@@ is@@ san@@ i : mark , come back .
to make us succe@@ e@@ ded , we need to play .
under a hat , i jo@@ ined myself with the history of autonom@@ y .
in our vie@@ ws , we went into all sorts of un@@ conven@@ mas areas .
so we are in a wonderful situation with power in the rich world .
these food skills from 2.@@ 5 to 1 , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t know what , for example , more sustainable proteins ? &quot;
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , they don &apos;t make your fish ? &quot;
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eg@@ gs to the birds .
it &apos;s the last tail , before a matter of the body .
because when the water goes out in the atlan@@ tic .
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
and what &apos;s research here is that this is particularly true with men .
but even in the con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts , we can do a lot of things .
that &apos;s just to see if you take a step back and look at the entire thing .
so we can go and take a look at all the ted prize prize .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be .
and from here , i can go into the page and put them back up .
and we became a four@@ -@@ and a half years at a real family .
nasa has a favorite sentence : fail is not an alternative . &quot;
then we have to re@@ build our mu@@ tations capacity in the web .
the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will rise .
every americans about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
now that &apos;s fundamental al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , but let &apos;s just go through it .
the micro@@ process@@ or is a mira@@ cle . the p@@ c is a mira@@ cle .
the ur@@ ani@@ um is consum@@ ed , a little bit like a c@@ and@@ le .
if we go back from there , like the 20@@ 20 per@@ cep@@ tivity ?
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can ful@@ fill it .
and it &apos;s sitting there , and there &apos;s 6@@ -@@ time , and then it &apos;s finished .
a nuclear re@@ actor , which provi@@ des itself a solution to the g@@ arb@@ age .
b@@ g : well , sa@@ dly life is the skep@@ tics in very different cam@@ ps .
and that &apos;s a thought that i think is for sur@@ ability .
i think that &apos;s really , and no , that &apos;s not a wh@@ ol@@ ly thinking .
we type , we &apos;re going to go , we go , that &apos;s okay .
well , studies have been condu@@ cted to see if that was true .
and they can do that because they don &apos;t connect cause and cor@@ relation not .
before leaving the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
they could try to exp@@ and the capacity of exi@@ sting a@@ part@@ ments .
he dem@@ and@@ ed in oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o , his stable she@@ et .
in the mean@@ time , i was prepar@@ ing on ted@@ global .
and they said , &quot; let us pres@@ cri@@ be pres@@ sing the rest of our country . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the ted@@ talk .
all par@@ ties , all the problems of society , suppor@@ ted this .
how well , do you think they are the decisions to over@@ come the decisions ?
this business , it was almost like a pleasure sav@@ ings .
okay . everyone &apos;s ready to take care of g@@ ary &apos;s &apos;s offer .
we can do better than more categ@@ ories than with more choices .
because the categ@@ ories tell me how i can tell them apart .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet until next satur@@ day .
now there are 10,000 par@@ o@@ dies of &quot; fri@@ day &quot; at youtube .
and today , we all feel like ow@@ ners of our culture .
the sc@@ ales came from the rest of the world .
they just share the building out of the city of the city of cities .
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i &apos;m thinking at the boat .
and the other thing is t@@ ans &apos;s mother today in fourth or fif@@ th row .
pictures that you have to change a moment to try to figure out the moment@@ um .
so it &apos;s more important to capture an idea than really a moment .
but this picture is actually completely combin@@ ed , from pictures of different places .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with this , i &apos;ve got over 4@@ ,000 people on twitter .
and over 10,000 a@@ e@@ ds have been mel@@ ted in the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
and they came up with great app@@ s , worked with urban mit@@ ters .
you &apos;re right to turn it up when it s@@ w@@ ells .
but she &apos;s doing something that doesn &apos;t do other regi@@ mes technology .
we now know nine cities that are planning to use these ap@@ p .
and not even like a tech company , but it &apos;s like the internet itself .
that &apos;s not political being active , that &apos;s off@@ ices .
and this app@@ s let us use our hands to make our communities better .
i &apos;m going to start by showing you a single , bor@@ ing slide .
and i tell people that i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist like that .
so how are we supposed to do the question for the characteri@@ stics of character ?
i literally grew up with a mother who taught me a day .
but when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
we should be able to fix everything that we want .
it was called the soc@@ cer world ma@@ ster@@ y .
hal@@ f-@@ time , people do a little bit of calls , go to toi@@ let .
but that &apos;s a lot of non-@@ useful things , and more complicated things .
at the same time , it &apos;s a real time stam@@ p , and it &apos;s a moving shot .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olymp@@ ics in london .
this has di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed everything , and it makes it available by the internet .
and just like that , the ice berg gives you another side of your person@@ ality .
so we decided to get tony -- temp@@ t -- and the thing to support .
anybody saw the film &quot; bu@@ tter@@ fly , &quot; and you saw a lot of them ?
all wealth can actually communicate with your eyes or draw them .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a magic board .
we have two creatures , both in the middle 197@@ 9 , exactly the same day .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated sphere i want to share with you today .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to people .
they knew the single bits and by@@ tes they needed to attack .
it &apos;s much more sophisti@@ cated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
this cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge in iran is spli@@ t down in 15 sig@@ ns .
and nei@@ ther the machine leaders , the security system , is going to notice it .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning .
tell me the &quot; why &quot; phase phase -- what does it bring us ?
today , more than any before , a little bit more ambi@@ tious .
big data will be trans@@ formed for organizations around the world in large opportunities .
that &apos;s the &quot; healthy , &quot; in the national world .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we do love to play with things .
and here is a really , very large picture of this little piece of metal .
so i took this thing in the way that you do a computer chip .
so quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that the physical objects feel the same .
this shows the enor@@ m@@ ously large role that can play a sea prote@@ cted area .
and i think it &apos;s a medical start , and that &apos;s me .
&quot; do you remember the patient that she car@@ ed home ? &quot;
you say you don &apos;t forget the names of the people that die .
if you have re@@ lie@@ ved , and never make the er@@ ror again .
and as he walked off the door , he showed up his ra@@ dar .
&quot; do you remember the patient &apos;s wir@@ es ? &quot;
what you need is an environment that you put in the position .
you might think he &apos;s fin@@ ner hun@@ ting , but that &apos;s not true .
and at the end of the day , they just want to get the re@@ lie@@ ved rema@@ ins .
of course , many people , scientists , con@@ fir@@ m that it was really different .
and that game was played by university profess@@ ors and so on .
because it ga@@ ined something that has lost in some way .
they also needed to regi@@ le a she@@ et of this writing in this des@@ k .
the reason the government was able to track back where a text came from .
and that &apos;s one of the three sources of sources that exist today .
it shows un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented , what happens if governments attac@@ ked their own citizens .
these are the questions that we have to emplo@@ y for the next 50 years .
a hundred years later , in 194@@ 7 , le@@ go came out .
but there is a major difference : the transi@@ st@@ or was just for experts .
the simple game is actually li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its , actually li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its is actually pretty sophisti@@ cated .
sometimes these ideas to make us think , in a very important way .
and i want to look at this on the scale of the planet of earth .
and it &apos;s all being used by the same letter and the same code .
my story starts right here in ra@@ j@@ as@@ than about two years ago .
it took pictures and text together , and anima@@ tion and touch .
fan@@ t@@ y@@ books have always been maps , but these maps were sta@@ tic .
my grandmother sat at the end of the slide and star@@ ed me .
she said , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; yeah . &quot;
of course , my grandmother would tell her to be a little bit special .
the united states today is the highest in@@ car@@ ance rate of the world .
she said , &quot; and what do you do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
another little bit , because i &apos;m going to show you a little bit on paper here .
finally , i went from my car and i went to the court sta@@ tions .
br@@ y@@ an , they actually brought a sa@@ ke up here for a sa@@ ke .
eight speak@@ ers : tsun@@ -@@ attac@@ king .
that &apos;s the out@@ come of faster computers that build faster computers .
today we can put together on do@@ zens of companies that have just done this .
we live on a planet that &apos;s 70 percent with water .
and there are new technologies , not 10 years or 20 years now , but now .
it &apos;s new nan@@ ot@@ echn@@ ologi@@ es along the way , nan@@ o-@@ materials .
by 20@@ 20 , we predict about two billion internet users .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people , not very bad .
par@@ tly with these ha@@ cking spaces , these lo@@ ps put them together .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to get from the top a to b ?
what does it have to do for our thinking and on our memory ?
then the next generation , in which we actually live today , lives a little bit of pri@@ mes .
and these two worl@@ ds just sna@@ sted up new and old thinking .
many use the word , you know , not what it means .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually just seen it .
and this is the proje@@ ction of sight , re@@ duc@@ tive , see .
because all talking about energy , but no one talks about the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem .
in the ground , over six percent of the carbon is saved .
traditional thinking in the environment , we are too many on the world .
you can only be cli@@ ff@@ l , if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
you &apos;ve got some of them from trees from trees ?
we are doing brazil in brazil in place where we go back to the nutri@@ ents .
we do that in china , for example , where we take the waste away .
and it &apos;s also interesting that you &apos;ve also enter@@ ed south asia .
there &apos;s op@@ e@@ c a bunch of wa@@ i@@ f@@ lage .
if you squ@@ ee@@ ze the wrong things , you have a g@@ arb@@ age problem .
as an ad@@ oles@@ cent of a music , i only got the ti@@ gh@@ ted notes .
i then say , with my own words , what could be written between this frame@@ work .
all that affec@@ ts me and all that affected me my experience with the com@@ position .
he asked me , what was the balance of these bal@@ la@@ des for me .
the serious co@@ verage no@@ wa@@ tion today is not fund@@ raising .
you don &apos;t need to make music yourself if it becomes a bor@@ ing .
but also , don &apos;t tell me , i don &apos;t understand the classi@@ c music .
so you &apos;re going to be able to listen to what you &apos;ve only considered in mind .
i said , ultra@@ f , what do you need a big car ?
and you can try that with words like ra@@ s@@ ses or an@@ x@@ iety or whatever .
it &apos;s a little ver@@ i@@ dly te@@ sted that he has a very different idea .
such a little bu@@ b , which is not interested in fire@@ s .
it &apos;s impossible to put things in a society that is supposed to work .
did you have ten@@ ure to kill the dis@@ cla@@ im@@ er ?
i mean , you don &apos;t even know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
that meant that he was re@@ lie@@ ved during the chinese invasi@@ on immediately .
over@@ wh@@ el@@ med up on the bottom of nasa .
but the spa@@ tial arr@@ ange@@ ment of the images is actually important in the matter of matter .
i don &apos;t know if i have time to show you other environments .
this is actually a poster by not@@ re d@@ ame , which was really recor@@ ded .
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s wrong about it .
all those choices have two effects , two negative effects of people .
beautiful beach . great day . they have everything for themselves .
clinical depression explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last generation .
it &apos;s possible to create the chemistry that has never been done before ?
a chromo@@ some is just a piece of chemical chemical material .
you see in the upp@@ er field , the chromo@@ some just dro@@ ps apart .
this is not an electr@@ on microscop@@ ic , and it &apos;s a regular microscop@@ e .
and i went back to explain to you how the machine works .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing .
and i &apos;ve been afraid many more things that nobody would explain .
a extraordinary stat@@ ement that you can do about your life work .
in fact , he can feel like par@@ an@@ or@@ mal .
that &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the can@@ al !
but even myself , even in my wall mode , sometimes this thing hit the thing .
but if you se@@ ttle , most drin@@ king water dro@@ ps away .
oil is a problem , and coal is the equivalent of the problem .
so the alli@@ ance for climate protection has two campaig@@ ns in life .
use america with 100 percent clean electricity in the next 10 years
it turns out that he wanted to st@@ ack up the si@@ ghts .
each has four different vari@@ ations ; you can sele@@ ct what you want to use .
there are effects that you can change live , like rever@@ se and filter filter .
but always the approach to the fact that it &apos;s just supposed to be useful and that should be acc@@ essi@@ ble .
and that hasn &apos;t really worked that , but we still learned a lot about it .
and then i took a sa@@ in@@ ese re@@ pen@@ der , and i put it on this .
now we are actually in the same context that we had the mes@@ h trick .
and it tran@@ sc@@ ends nine billion . that &apos;s going to move nine billion .
i have times , ge@@ ologi@@ cally , fusion , fusion and bio@@ fu@@ els .
in her imagination , tra@@ mi@@ mi@@ ff@@ s and prob@@ ability tend to really live a life like that ?
and with each attemp@@ t , the children are doing whatever , and what doesn &apos;t work .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around , and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
so , it isn &apos;t interesting that high compe@@ tors have a strong effect ?
they were surro@@ unding people , educ@@ ated people , infe@@ cted people .
well , studies should be done ; this is a serious matter .
he &apos;s developing a few other people who are v@@ acc@@ ine v@@ acc@@ ine .
she wouldn &apos;t vac@@ cin@@ ate her kid against child ch@@ asing .
that &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark ur@@ ine .
it &apos;s not about turning genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
i &apos;m not a doctor , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing to me .
i &apos;m going to take something that is obvious , and let it look real look .
you can see the same , but you can also see away , if you want them .
co2 war@@ mer planets and the equ@@ ation for co2 is actually quite clear .
and people say , &quot; okay . i don &apos;t have that right . &quot;
i would show my arm , and show them that there are no spo@@ ts .
or , &quot; how was your journey to al@@ b@@ ania ? &quot; or something like that .
actually , we don &apos;t choose between experience . we sele@@ ct the experience between experiences .
now , they would know about his hei@@ ght , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty .
some of you might be thinking , &quot; that &apos;s a full amount of time for games . &quot;
why is it impossible in games that you couldn &apos;t just do anything ?
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right job .
we have the game super@@ stru@@ ct in the institute for the future .
and he said , &quot; well , they could bar@@ ely remember myself .
very important in this study was that teachers weren &apos;t in@@ struc@@ ting .
are we in a kind of evolutionary im@@ balance in a form ?
and one night , there &apos;s a mon@@ key on its hotel door .
in front of front of him , a gor@@ ge@@ ous thing happened in front of him .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super@@ sex . &quot;
until the 198@@ 0s , the farm was in the hands of ar@@ gent@@ ina .
it &apos;s something that isn &apos;t ro@@ p aci@@ di@@ ty , material nature .
here , they need some lo@@ gic , but also to lie .
and now our dec@@ ei@@ ves feels immediately , so you can do something .
that has to do with us that we go back to the four@@ ths century .
if you grow more wind power , the system starts to fail .
that &apos;s the power of a hundred nuclear power station because it &apos;s very quick everywhere .
we weren &apos;t then five people to re@@ build a society .
if you just sit that down , it &apos;ll take some time .
and we can get two milli@@ seconds of two milli@@ seconds out of it .
we &apos;ve got 4@@ -@@ leg@@ wat@@ wat@@ ts of photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ts in germany .
there &apos;s a lot of resi@@ stance , and there &apos;s a lot of con@@ tradi@@ ction .
and then he ad@@ ded , &quot; we are essentially a world .
so i decided the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t do .
a friend of journ@@ alists had been talking about this fish for a long time ago .
who can ta@@ ke a fish like that when he was co@@ ver@@ a@@ yed ?
the sou@@ l is something that says about lei@@ ni@@ z .
it took about 90 percent of the birds , which are a lot of birds .
and in 198@@ 2 a span@@ ish company has bought the country .
he said , &quot; no . they do that because the food is better . &quot;
we are not reali@@ stic , we are more enjo@@ yed . we loved lo@@ ver .
that &apos;s the one that comes back to two billion years of labor .
and if we can do this for ra@@ w data , why not inclu@@ de in@@ content ?
so i can zo@@ om in in a particular time tra@@ ding in a particular time frame .
here &apos;s the stat@@ ement of the entire dem@@ o that i &apos;ve been thinking about here .
and i can , sort of , anything i &apos;ve been looking at today , again .
right now in the world , we think that data is a cur@@ se .
and instead of just being able to get into information , we can get through this .
so films of the way , images and stories combin@@ ed together .
they don &apos;t exist in one sun@@ -@@ sun@@ light system , as we do .
but i didn &apos;t understand much of leadership before leaving this expedi@@ tions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
in other words , every step here is a potential in circu@@ ession .
people are always up@@ set when i say , &quot; nar@@ row . &quot;
every single harvard as@@ ks now on a lifetime fund .
go from the choices to the many , then they re@@ main .
three things : ta@@ ste@@ maker , shared communities and un@@ expected .
because you just do that , if you &apos;re doing yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te mountain .
if you want to know it , those other hor@@ ses are also fine days .
what kind of books are you able to be able to write in which there are these ?
because that is , of course , a picture that you can &apos;t pick up with your camera .
and you can do that through those sorts of things , but also through crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
but what you &apos;re actually doing is to show what &apos;s possible today with technology .
it &apos;s called &quot; mol@@ ens &quot; in the offi@@ cial dat@@ ab@@ ase .
and he didn &apos;t really have an idea . he begins with the veter@@ ens .
one citi@@ zen helped another citizens , but the government played a central role here .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve the citi@@ zen@@ ship .
that &apos;s a slide i cho@@ se from my sk@@ ill@@ ch .
so if you &apos;re just watching it about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
so this is allo@@ wing us again as a uni@@ fied organis@@ m .
i don &apos;t know what any transi@@ st@@ or is doing in the sum@@ mit machine .
i just go to k@@ ho@@ ya , an inter@@ active i@@ pad ap@@ p .
this map is growing , and it &apos;s working on the other side of the book .
and we bring them back , in a con@@ temporary history for children .
their parents were born in virg@@ ini@@ a when they were born in virg@@ ini@@ a .
she was something that made you always want to be close to her .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want you . just make your own . &quot;
in 197@@ 2 , there were 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 people in sharks and prison prison .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
but for afri@@ can@@ americans in this country , it was a time of terror@@ ism .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what makes meaning to our actions in history .
but think about a way that is integr@@ ated in our own lives .
we do . that &apos;s how ration@@ ali@@ zing we are , as much as we intelle@@ ct .
they come from ideas that are driven by the per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve in our he@@ arts .
and you know , that part of the life needs everything else the rest of the life .
we call these robots at ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y bi@@ on@@ ics .
but sa@@ dly , bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are famous among the pri@@ mates .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- how people -- they love to play their lives .
so sex@@ ics are spread , both with bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s as well as humans .
democracy was growing , but at the same time , science was also growing .
and that &apos;s what they really did is pre@@ p@@ are the future civil rights movement .
now in practice , people are not te@@ sted on their chromo@@ some .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
if all the answers , i feel like i won .
now , today , our environment begins for the first time , to answer us .
they cause a water bi@@ as with the point of water .
and we got the re@@ venue building a building at the exp@@ o exp@@ o .
mt is one of the leading gra@@ ff@@ iti artist in the &apos; 8@@ 0s .
i said , &quot; very arch@@ a@@ ic , how could that be ? &quot;
so we are , to find out how to make it better , faster and stron@@ ger .
evolution is not inevi@@ table to pre@@ fer the lon@@ gest life .
imagine a large explosion , as you get down on 1,000 feet .
the pilot had shif@@ ted the machine , and we weren &apos;t that far away .
they actually knew they knew the size of machine services .
and that gave us large insi@@ ght to that , which we investi@@ g@@ ated here .
we need to change the consequences , and we start pre@@ p@@ are to pre@@ p@@ are ourselves .
there are only one plus , to happiness , to happiness .
our politicians tell it to tell our president , even our ce@@ os say it .
now , i can answer all your questions and give them an ex@@ hau@@ sting version .
a large lea@@ p full of them , so we &apos;ll wel@@ come the risk .
so to get close to that , you can go to the ris@@ es .
i remember looking at a kid playing on a boat at a ni@@ ght@@ hold .
he was another child , and he went all the way around .
you know how un@@ comfortable it is in a very crow@@ ded el@@ ev@@ ator ?
how would you deal with this fact that your body is cent@@ r@@ alized in the room ?
they &apos;ve been building two cities in china , and the third is in prepar@@ ation .
why did i not ask the high school ? why did i draw her home ?
it &apos;s a de@@ fau@@ mer out of pla@@ do@@ s that was afraid in the dar@@ k@@ ness .
lights , li@@ t , solar , mot@@ ors -- everything should be available .
they &apos;re de@@ cep@@ tive , light , clay , and sen@@ sor sen@@ ti@@ ments .
they had this program sold for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 euro@@ s on the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government .
in those actions , a fol@@ ded guy was called the fin@@ s .
over time , there &apos;s a little fish , and we think that &apos;s worth the standard .
they were not e@@ aten , you throw them away because they were dead .
i went there because i was growing up in europe , and i wanted to work in africa .
in this state , about 24@@ ,000 can@@ adi@@ ans are dying .
how can i teach them my fau@@ lt so they don &apos;t do the same ?
he had a potential quality of life called epi@@ gl@@ ot@@ ti@@ tis .
it turns out that he &apos;s got a p@@ to@@ co@@ c@@ re infe@@ ction infe@@ ction .
vac@@ la@@ v ha@@ Ã¯@@ , the great cher@@ ch politi@@ cian , once said .
and it wasn &apos;t on my su@@ it@@ ly , he was very up@@ set .
and after two , three days seemed to realize that she was not going to res@@ oc@@ ate .
and it worked for a time , until i hit my wife .
she &apos;s a lot better than that year ; she &apos;s on the up@@ sta@@ irs .
it &apos;s not about the car@@ car@@ ste , the problem is acc@@ essi@@ ble .
the king of si@@ am i got al@@ umin@@ um infe@@ ction .
the basis of a lot of them are creating technologies , and they grow ex@@ cep@@ ti@@ stic .
different speak@@ ers . mass destruction . tor@@ na@@ do .
he said , &quot; j@@ im@@ my , what do you do in court court ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started discus@@ sing .
that all of us are more than the worst what we &apos;ve ever done .
because they &apos;ve already shif@@ ted twice the pre-@@ state cha@@ irs .
whereas the language invol@@ ves the language of sub@@ mis@@ si@@ ble ran@@ g .
so , you can explain a lot better , because there &apos;s a lot more , more than that .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities is clear .
that was then through the ancient world and the first form of abstra@@ ction .
because steve jobs used to tell you that you need to make it worse .
gest@@ ings of the sen@@ ti@@ ment , gest@@ ures of the continent and so on .
so in front of the world , we &apos;re thinking , well , we see from back@@ wards .
so i &apos;m designing as much as a figure , the behavior that look as the behavior .
and once upon a time , i have an interface that &apos;s more intui@@ tive and much more natural .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid ?
there are only more se@@ ats in ama@@ zon regi@@ ons alone in ama@@ zon .
that means that all of our intelligence is that we want to be stupid as trees .
and in our western world , we &apos;ve been too stupid to bring our food back .
that means you can see in the internet , as you can tell the nutri@@ ents back .
we tell people , oh yeah , you don &apos;t have environ@@ ment@@ ally conscious in the south .
and you have to do it , and understand it , and understand it .
there are the decade , but in the landscape , right ?
so , the baby is carbon positive for life , from the beginning .
so , the music works for me as much as the spo@@ ken language language .
you study the works that he com@@ posed before and after@@ wards .
you put a new idea into it , and it will answer the answer to a response .
every time it &apos;s exciting , it &apos;s always a new thing over and over again , i &apos;m going to read something new .
if the failure is happening , students will get the next hard tun@@ e .
okay , there we go in the front , that &apos;s a ra@@ pid piece .
i wonder you often have a lot of fundamental pleasure .
our vo@@ cal ja@@ fer to sing our hands and feet to dance .
the mel@@ o@@ dies emer@@ ge from healthy and rhyth@@ m from the dance .
and there &apos;s this story of bis@@ cho@@ a &apos;s history of wor@@ che@@ ster .
she particularly loved him because he has a tenden@@ cy to re@@ duc@@ ance .
this is this analy@@ tics coming here , and here , in this de@@ mis@@ e talk .
in fact , you have to prove if there &apos;s no such thing as random liber@@ ty .
i think it &apos;s better if we live our large creative super@@ ange@@ ment .
christ@@ ent@@ ity , islam , budd@@ h@@ ism or whatever .
it &apos;s not going to create a di@@ stor@@ tion of reality , but the resol@@ ution of reality .
but you ask the indi@@ ans , they say , &quot; the plant talks to us . &quot;
we &apos;ve also done something on the corner of the guar@@ di@@ an that is the guar@@ di@@ an .
so this is live in the internet . it &apos;s driven by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on .
you know , i never thought i &apos;m going to work at microsoft .
i want to start with what i call &quot; the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
should i get married ? should i just do children , or do new job ? &quot;
they really want to get the decision , if it &apos;s all infin@@ ity , right ?
when you were in 100 species , one of them should have been perfect .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sent@@ ences , thoughts .
12 to 24 hours later , everything seemed like it was like it .
it lo@@ ves blue because of the genes that we had put together .
they &apos;ve seen ma@@ ize &apos;s eth@@ an@@ ol , which is just a bad experiment .
with your chem@@ ist block , john -- how you do that ?
but the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i didn &apos;t just ri@@ p outside with the spe@@ ar .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
not the work itself . it &apos;s always been as dark as e@@ h and ever .
this is the can@@ al se@@ a@@ q river in southern west green@@ land .
this is the gl@@ aci@@ er , the drin@@ king blood source for this city .
four times as many in the last 30 years , like in the previous 75 years .
if you look at this in the histor@@ ic context , you can see what it is .
the united states is one of the most common air , combin@@ ed with china .
this is in our entire country of secon@@ d-@@ scale flow flow .
so let &apos;s make a tour of modern , clean co@@ w factory .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
it &apos;s a story , and it can decide how you evolved .
and now i collect the filter , for something more expression .
so it was a curious and i wanted to kind of den@@ se into the matter of the matter , like that .
and what are our values and what are our actions , our foundation ?
a project that i started with was to build a gene gun .
there are these ancient wor@@ se@@ cu@@ bes , she@@ ep . you know ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be co@@ z , but it would be nice .
but that &apos;s really not the point here , and then i open my hand .
if you take a cap@@ su@@ le , even more effective than any shape of any shape .
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other hand .
now , the remin@@ dent self makes more sense than to remember and telling stories .
there are actually two concep@@ ts of happiness that we can use , a one-@@ on-@@ one selves .
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for sight is a fairly complicated process .
if you ask the happiness of the self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
in the other self , the memory self , you get a different story .
this is a players who are on the ver@@ ge of something called the epi@@ c se@@ as .
oh , you know that . ok . so we &apos;ve got some players here .
that &apos;s me , as i am in life , i do a bad face .
so you know about the theory of success , theory of success of success per hour .
so the big question is , &quot; what are players doing good ? &quot;
not as i am ... developing games , i &apos;m a little jum@@ g@@ ging .
not fear , not cros@@ sing , car@@ ff , disappe@@ ared , disappe@@ ared .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
they played wor@@ ms for 18 years , we play for 16 years .
we &apos;re asking epi@@ c se@@ ams , and we give people the opportunity to reach them .
our language affec@@ ts our thinking and how we see the world around us .
so , again , change and adap@@ tations are the great cap@@ abilities of human beings .
we can change a new meaning that goes out of sever@@ e times .
wi@@ dri@@ ties are a change that we haven &apos;t adap@@ ted yet yet .
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who already suff@@ ers more creativity .
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the su@@ sie . &quot;
these are decisions with their grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children , they need to go .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , the number of times .
this is the world &apos;s world bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in the forest of con@@ go .
as a result , the body has a typical fe@@ min@@ ine of fe@@ min@@ ine fe@@ min@@ ine .
and when he was born , he saw like a boy -- no one knew anything .
okay , just a quick example for a vari@@ ation of inter@@ sexu@@ ality .
i just show the top 500 of the most popular wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ ums .
and i might want to introdu@@ ce myself to introdu@@ ce you to that .
i &apos;ve been working in the colle@@ c@@ tivity for years , that was bas@@ is@@ s@@ c .
and i &apos;ve brought you a project that i want you to imagine now .
on this island , that &apos;s the island of gra@@ ci@@ o@@ sa on the a@@ z@@ ors .
and in the course of that , three of these things are always being war@@ ned .
the brown is kind of the conven@@ tional system , the green is our system .
we can also put a hundred kil@@ o@@ wat@@ ts of vol@@ ta@@ ics on the grid .
the sp@@ elling reser@@ ve has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; what are sustainable proteins proteins ? &quot;
he came up on the table with a bright white color .
it &apos;s near the mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to of the river called gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ r .
they grow car@@ ni@@ c@@ attle on what was basically fire areas .
now , they couldn &apos;t do that that the val@@ ve worked , not economic .
it &apos;s been evol@@ ved during evolution , and it &apos;s in@@ tra@@ c@@ table .
now , i want to take this idea a little bit away with about something a little bit mad .
i &apos;ve been asked to ask li@@ l@@ ly if i could mention her .
immediately , we get a taste about the top@@ ics that are on wikipedia at the most popular .
so i can take a step back , and immediately jump to a specific se@@ duc@@ tion .
and if we know , we can even pull out even more suff@@ i@@ ed from this .
so the set was that the measu@@ re@@ ment of the blu@@ e@@ print is the blu@@ e@@ print of the ship .
no slide , no more honor , no money . what do you do ?
and the na@@ sty d@@ ure of your team is more important than any dou@@ bt of the world .
now when i use the word &quot; mira@@ cle , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
there are some innova@@ tions in nuclear dis@@ count ; model , liquid .
they talk about how it &apos;s going to look , they hit power .
what you might ask is : why is this ? why ? what about those ?
it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
this number goes up , and it goes very quickly , and that &apos;s acc@@ essi@@ ble .
i think we can power the world with energy that they don &apos;t cut at the same time .
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what those are the reasons that they are .
never mind in this country , 16@@ 0,000 times in the world in the last year .
i looked through the sho@@ ot wall and i saw them stand on the other side .
it &apos;s not like they are both ex@@ clu@@ si@@ vely or the same .
but you don &apos;t need them to describe them around the large conven@@ tional objects around us .
and a new city inclu@@ des new opportunities for leadership .
millions of people die every year la@@ tin american and go to the united states .
for about 12 percent of their decisions , they needed an hour or more of their time .
we decided to do an experiment , and we cho@@ se mar@@ ap@@ s for our experiment .
we don &apos;t choose deci@@ ding ourselves even when it comes to our own best intern@@ als .
you know , the average ma@@ cr@@ on today , you &apos;re off@@ ering 4@@ 5,000 products .
now before we started with this day , i had a conversation with g@@ ary .
this is a high-@@ tech categ@@ ory .
so let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : a car of a car .
when i start with the simple fan , i &apos;m learning how i choose .
just like the &quot; double rain@@ bo@@ w seems to be it from nothing . &quot;
&quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at is anima@@ tion and music in infin@@ ls .
with 17 , she became the second woman of a mand@@ ar@@ in whose mother she hat@@ ed her .
i went to see , and realized slowly that these children were actually suggest@@ ing something .
we told their stories , and they sa@@ fer that we were still on her .
if there &apos;s a band in our family , then it turns through the women .
but if i could give this to you and i could make it sec@@ ure , i would .
it &apos;s not about what reali@@ stic is , but what we think of as reali@@ stic .
no one knew where the next life@@ -@@ saving a@@ ed was at that moment .
so , what did we do ? we did crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing in the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
now -- -- i &apos;m just going to jump through the video -- i &apos;ll just leave the video .
instead of sending them into the third world , we text them in ra@@ th@@ als .
they were there in febru@@ ary , and there &apos;s been a lot of fun last febru@@ ary .
and they realized that the city would never fre@@ ak out these hy@@ dr@@ ants .
so he did what any good design would do , he wrote an ap@@ p .
but in &quot; the &quot; fin@@ s &quot; is everything that everybody can see it .
and most people understand that , they believe that this is the input on the other .
this is a generation that has grown up with their voices as gran@@ ted .
they use their hands to write appli@@ cations that improve government &apos;s work .
and more than anything else , they are the best parents that they can only be ?
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they &apos;ve done for us was great .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from an@@ atom@@ y .
he said , &quot; tell me what the fe@@ min@@ ism female is female . &quot;
if you think they &apos;re looking good , it &apos;s almost sec@@ ure .
so before i go home to broo@@ kl@@ yn , i &apos;m going to take it all back .
this would , in engineering teams , a real time control system .
now , all our objects , our environment , begins to speak back to us .
and that changes radi@@ cally the interaction that we have human beings outside of our world .
you see in the middle of the k@@ olo@@ s@@ se@@ um , the ti@@ vers .
and the plastic bottle that we throw away every day is still there .
imagine if anybody can give a little sp@@ in for a point of ima@@ gery .
as a ice mountain s@@ nu@@ ps , i at@@ me up his pre-@@ ti@@ pre@@ a@@ tives .
and somebody who has an arti@@ stic potential to make sure that much more .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
now , i had a unique place that day -- i sat on 1@@ d .
our ancestors weren &apos;t working on the question of fighting when someone was dead .
the idea behind the chair is pretty simple .
so , we needed theor@@ ies about these goals that could dis@@ per@@ si@@ ble us or resi@@ stant .
and many times , we just walked into a b@@ loo@@ dy , and we had to re@@ collect ourselves .
and in fact , this fal@@ se of ti@@ x@@ ly recor@@ ded data has been recor@@ ded .
so despite that war@@ ning , i knew that anyone could buy the nam@@ es of the name .
but it &apos;s a tough thing about the movie or a hard thing for me ?
but when it comes to the fact that it &apos;s supposed to be trans@@ formed anything .
there are your version , there are my version , and there are the real version . &quot;
what about me ? what about the actual prin@@ ting yp@@ es ?
and so i found a company called ol@@ son z@@ ol@@ man in pit@@ ts@@ burgh .
it doesn &apos;t have to be fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed . what kind of 18 meas@@ ures are they ?
and i think some companies are just going to focus on a strength rather than on the two .
i think if you hold people , then you get them closer to failure .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and its access .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you do for 10 billion scre@@ ens ? &quot;
if somebody is taking something that doesn &apos;t bel@@ ong to him , he &apos;s not just a die@@ ck .
here , with film , paper and water bot@@ tles , like geor@@ d ...
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ ue is that it &apos;s a growing library .
li@@ tt@@ ing@@ es are electr@@ onic mo@@ du@@ le that have a specific function .
this is what i &apos;m talking about in est@@ es of est@@ tu in est@@ eland .
they use online attac@@ ks to make a lot of money , a lot of money .
basically , the bottom of the ocean came back and then thro@@ wn back .
in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , it was ma@@ mm@@ ed in great style .
the rest of the day , i had this na@@ ked feeling in my sto@@ mach .
and there are now hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
these people represent multiple shor@@ tage dollars that will flow into the global economy .
it &apos;s not mira@@ cle that everybody thinks that the world is worse .
bin laden kill@@ s a hei@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed risk of risk of risk .
we &apos;ve ri@@ b@@ bled ourselves from the r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic of be@@ pun@@ ity .
and yet , 4@@ 6 percent of all dau@@ gh@@ ters weren &apos;t with a pre@@ domin@@ ation .
i get these kids who sent@@ enced too hard stra@@ ins .
these little oil sp@@ ills were the most primi@@ tive cell form .
we need to change ways of making these problems : these problems , that suffering .
it would be more knowledge of us , and human beings are . &quot;
i &apos;m talking about ra@@ pid and the question , if we &apos;re right to kill the right .
and they thought that this was the top@@ ics that we should care about .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? all drin@@ k does . &quot;
i had something , you know , my sister had a be@@ er . go a be@@ er . &quot;
i thought , &quot; yeah , grand@@ ma . i &apos;m talking . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
she also was a lot of argu@@ ments in our family .
if i look at these programs , then i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
and then finally , i have programs that can make the numbers perfect .
and it makes it part in ways that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
and the next steps , like electr@@ on@@ ics , are very few decades of re@@ gre@@ t .
and that &apos;s why , for example , the ability for antibio@@ tics grow .
and that made these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
they say that who doesn &apos;t have a sou@@ l that is dead , and he can &apos;t cla@@ im anything .
the next generation of graphi@@ cs are already working very much with behavior .
so , he doesn &apos;t want to think he &apos;s going to make it easy to think about it , but it &apos;s very simple indeed .
in israel , if you say a human life , you &apos;re going to res@@ ist the earth .
a woman in germany eating about six kil@@ ogra@@ ms during its lifetime .
so , we don &apos;t need cli@@ man@@ tra@@ l , we can be climate posi@@ tively .
the work of the interpre@@ ter starts a little bit like a theater of a theater .
i said , well , you need something like the spo@@ ken language language .
i ans@@ wer@@ ed , but i can tell you if you like it or not .
so , yes , they don &apos;t make sure that they can &apos;t co@@ ok because they can &apos;t co@@ ok .
so you don &apos;t have to zi@@ p in classi@@ c music because you don &apos;t play an instrument .
or what i &apos;m talking about today , because what you might have thought about .
they can make them less easily , yes , neighb@@ or , or the ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless .
why do we have to prevent people &apos;s knowledge , if it &apos;s true ?
so we should be percei@@ ved as something that should be true for our lives .
so the second sentence is , if it &apos;s right , it &apos;s not a sou@@ l .
there are fe@@ atures , where i know exactly where i need to hear .
the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ c es@@ el is a mul@@ le that invol@@ ves r@@ ure nature .
you don &apos;t want to name that that would be a little bit politi@@ tically in@@ cor@@ rect .
people always ask me , what did you do in ad@@ oles@@ cents ?
now , with inv@@ e@@ stors , i &apos;ve negoti@@ ated new life she@@ ets .
mu@@ st-@@ run is simply running the power station to keep the frequ@@ ence .
and you really have to re@@ main quite tough , but i think it &apos;s going to go .
what went to na@@ than@@ iel , so it brought him back into a community of friends .
i said , &quot; how much of the dis@@ order of food is chicken ? &quot;
no , not because i &apos;m a self-@@ enjo@@ yed and gu@@ cher .
he looked at me as if i quot@@ ed a song from whit@@ ney hou@@ ston .
she ta@@ sted swe@@ et and pi@@ cks as if you would take a bis@@ count from the ocean .
and then he ad@@ ded to say , &quot; but our water has no budget . &quot;
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical issue of age .
well that &apos;s all right at the time of science fi@@ ction cap@@ ial .
and my love to the ocean , with the same inten@@ sity as ever , and the same inten@@ sity .
i had it better . all those choices en@@ ab@@ led me to have better .
what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor , which is the relationship between the individual and the nature of nature .
the father of this young man was identi@@ fied as follo@@ wers of the microscop@@ e .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all g@@ uns and all tools .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that politicians don &apos;t do anything .
this is b@@ lea@@ k house of di@@ ck@@ ens . every colum@@ n is a chap@@ ter .
of course , the ma@@ pping is a really open app@@ lic@@ ation for a technology like this .
this is a project called photo@@ syn@@ th , which conne@@ cts them two different technologies .
and ri@@ ck s@@ ze@@ li@@ pl@@ i was condu@@ cted by microsoft , a good collaboration .
look at this as the sequ@@ el of the work of ste@@ phen law@@ l@@ ers on virtual earth .
the only real choice was , &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after@@ wards .
and in fact , they should . these are important questions .
a effect , parado@@ x , is that he &apos;s paraly@@ zed , rather than free .
what could be better ? &quot; &quot; dam@@ n man thinking , &quot; it &apos;s aug@@ ust .
it makes a stat@@ ement about being able to live , and maybe things slowly slow to do things slowly .
do you want the butt@@ oned or ri@@ gi@@ d ? stone or ac@@ id was@@ h ?
when each of them were born in this room , 6@@ ,000 languages were spoke on the planet .
these organisms can be completely dry ; they can even be able to live in vac@@ u@@ um .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can see it even with the light microscop@@ e .
we &apos;re at six to nine billion people growing up in the next 40 years .
then , of course , there &apos;s all this carbon flow that goes into the air .
we are stri@@ pping out on the fron@@ ti@@ ers of biological reality and of our imagination .
this squ@@ ee@@ ze 1@@ -@@ thousand traffic lights when the machine &apos;s on high-@@ capacity .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about this , and i ask myself , why ?
and last month , researchers were saying that the entire continent has now a negative ice she@@ et .
fro@@ sty of carbon is a pleas@@ ant , happy bur@@ sters .
this is a con@@ ception in thinking about how we understand a lot of our environment .
so , o@@ .@@ k , now , in biology , you don &apos;t need material .
so it hasn &apos;t the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically effective .
that &apos;s me , i believe , that there are less people who actually exi@@ sted in there .
and with some kind of paper lights , we can make these virtual worl@@ ds visible .
this is just through pressure , and it &apos;s in@@ formed with gu@@ tt@@ berg and others .
for one week , everything i &apos;ve done in my su@@ it@@ case is everything i &apos;ve done in my su@@ it@@ case .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
it &apos;s what we think about the people we describe with these words .
so we have to look beyond the patent science , and focus on all of human possibilities .
we dou@@ bt about a common ance@@ st@@ or about six or eight million years ago .
in this period time , there may be 20 or 25 different different kinds of home@@ put by hom@@ ini@@ ds .
evolution fin@@ ds the creatures that ada@@ pt the best to their environment .
they are , in some cultures , the choice , to have more men than women .
so let me introdu@@ ce you to h@@ ul@@ c -- or the human universal form of car@@ rier .
one of the things that was common friend@@ ly : somebody had had a pair of shoes .
i just come back from a community that knows the secret of the evolution of humanity .
but lu@@ ck@@ ily , we over@@ r@@ ated this thing in the nar@@ ration of human evolution .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that this destruction is the survival of the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s dangerous .
and that &apos;s why ho@@ d sta@@ tions are te@@ sto@@ ster@@ ed .
he had an extreme form of an in@@ na@@ te side dete@@ c@@ tors .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happened in 17@@ 7@@ 6 with the green fa@@ thers .
it &apos;s an online play that you have to over@@ come an oil shor@@ tage .
and if you think they &apos;re not good at looking good , they probably are right .
and if the automo@@ bile and the driver were good enough , then they won the race .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o ...
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of in@@ efficient planets in the system .
on the le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand side , you see the dots that have different cap@@ ill@@ es .
but the cool@@ est , what i &apos;ve ever worked on was this guy .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of someone else and this is his room .
i could see it in their eyes , and i was hearing that life was too close .
i &apos;d like to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about me that day .
i &apos;m not trying to be right ; i decide to be happy .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that others could be hit by stu@@ x@@ net .
and if you do that , eventually , a cyber@@ -@@ wea@@ pon wea@@ pon wea@@ pon wea@@ pon .
so , fortunately , the biggest number of goals for these attac@@ ks are not in the middle east .
thank you so much for coming to mind , r@@ al@@ ph .
now this brand , the qu@@ al@@ com@@ m sta@@ thi@@ on , the sta@@ irs center ...
it &apos;s a blog where you see the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
we then did that , and we made a pre-@@ competi@@ tive advantage for a long time .
but in secret , i really wanted to di@@ ve the real w@@ re@@ ck of ti@@ tan@@ ic .
that &apos;s tremend@@ ously important . it &apos;s a good set of marketing . &quot;
and i &apos;m flying through a little robo@@ tic experience through the ge@@ ese of the ship .
i mean , it &apos;s actually just that , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
we &apos;re just playing the production costs . it doesn &apos;t take any tra@@ ce .
not an important thing , the innovation was dem@@ and@@ ing the risk of risk .
so , what we have to do on a global scale is to create a new system .
in this case , we have to give tools and get a mira@@ cle in very short time .
if you want to suppor@@ t around 100 percent , you need an incredible bat@@ tery .
i think here in the ted group , there are many , many who are there now .
and because you burn these 99 percent , it &apos;s a very much better profi@@ le .
now , his new mas@@ ks is : &quot; why don &apos;t research have the research anymore ? &quot;
con@@ struc@@ tors recogni@@ zing this type of collaboration as the core world of an i@@ ter@@ ative .
you might ask , why would someone actually invest@@ ed a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge ?
so we went to &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; my next film , much more .
a large machine , a cool , ted machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
they don &apos;t have them right at their own facts . &apos; per@@ mission , they don &apos;t have them .
but you know , i do what i &apos;m doing . i made the paper , i went on .
we &apos;re talking about that , with small leadership mar@@ ker , &quot; progress .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same thing .
it can save the lives of 4@@ ,000 , 50@@ 0,000 children per year in the developing world .
take them , take the disease back , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
i know they did that because half of americans do that every day .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
sorry about that , if you look at them , look away , don &apos;t look around .
these are real patients who are sub@@ f@@ ting a pain@@ ful ha@@ sty .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use while we are in the world .
if you don &apos;t have a player , you might have some of the zer@@ an@@ an@@ ces in this picture .
we have never , if we play games games , they simply simply don &apos;t exist .
at that point , i was ap@@ poin@@ ted to the car@@ di@@ c center of car@@ di@@ c service .
seven million people are on cur@@ ren@@ cy or with un@@ related leg@@ is@@ lation .
they say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up with them . &quot;
and yet , in our land , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
and i had not just written him , but i sent him to the court .
he said , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , did you put this crazy thing ? &quot;
and he always looked through the windows and i could hear that entire to@@ w@@ ha@@ h@@ u .
this is a fact that it &apos;s been put in a context with the increas@@ ed in@@ car@@ ance numbers .
rec@@ ession . fe@@ eding . do@@ om@@ s@@ day . eg@@ y@@ day .
16 ter@@ a@@ wat@@ ts cost in the earth &apos;s surface eight minutes .
but now to the biggest force that will lead us to a world of the over@@ river .
and instead of economic gri@@ d@@ lock , i see one of the largest econom@@ ic students in history .
we are the sa@@ is@@ on@@ ing near and move us to the world cham@@ ber .
he said , &quot; grand@@ ma told all of them that they are something special . &quot;
i gave her as@@ pir@@ in . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the he@@ arts .
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a stupid mistake ?
and i gave him a repres@@ entation for pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin and la@@ sted him .
it &apos;s almost an ide@@ ological response to the way that anti@@ bodies are attac@@ king a human .
in the united states , the institute for medicine is the number 10@@ 0,000 .
and you know about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
90 percent of our imagination was wi@@ ms , other animals that are connected to the cause .
at the time , we focus on the big animals , and the ocean is the big fish .
it sounds strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of stress block@@ el .
in@@ cre@@ ti@@ zed building blocks became very quick in the world in the world .
they can put a switch in between and so they created a little di@@ x .
we want to put each individual interaction on the world in a consumer bri@@ ck .
like most adults on the boat , my mother had a little tox@@ ic bottle on her .
man 4 : my brand is de@@ de@@ x , because i &apos;ve been ex@@ hau@@ sted .
thank you , brand s@@ co@@ hol s@@ co@@ hol c@@ lon@@ es .
what &apos;s the ma@@ cab@@ ine sta@@ dium at the same time ?
are they something that a little bit quie@@ t , reser@@ va@@ tives , more conser@@ va@@ tive ?
we went to sa@@ o pau@@ l@@ o , where foreign adverti@@ sing has been ban@@ ned .
we then shot a team , a great man@@ ler , and we started with this .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bom@@ bay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
this is a repres@@ entation of your brain ; your brain can be spli@@ t in two hal@@ ves .
in summer , hon@@ dur@@ as hon@@ dur@@ as shares under a he@@ el re@@ plac@@ ement .
the other place , which was really interested in the city department , is sing@@ apo@@ re .
or even sho@@ z of these cities , or hundreds of people around the world ?
think about the first piece of life , a man who bur@@ ns his life .
and i would be happy if ce@@ g was going to help us do this .
a school uni@@ form to the butt@@ ons because she had six years to go .
it &apos;s a nice little ap@@ p where you can adop@@ t a hy@@ dr@@ ants .
if we want these institution to work for us , we need to do off@@ cra@@ cra@@ cy sex@@ y .
the next steps , like the ner@@ ve system and the brain , took some hundred millions of years .
and so -- here goes , &quot; this box is heard ... &quot; i write my name .
so that &apos;s how you have to laun@@ ch the i@@ pad and make the fire@@ flies go out .
so you actually create a digital colle@@ ction of photographs that you can put in care online .
there &apos;s a number of ways of using magic , and technology conne@@ cts to each other .
when i met her as a little boy , she came to me and her hu@@ g@@ ged me .
she pus@@ hed me so hard that i was able to brea@@ the it . then she left me .
then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got three things i &apos;ve got you to do , br@@ y@@ an . &quot;
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent people &apos;s knowledge of knowledge .
we could only compare as am@@ or@@ p@@ gens around the world around the ocean .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less sk@@ ul@@ l .
so , our entire intelligence means that we want to be stupid as trees , yes ?
it &apos;s safe to be less sk@@ ul@@ ful , which is oil consumption .
these are si@@ x-@@ leg@@ ged countries that gover@@ n 4@@ 40 percent of the oil supp@@ lies .
in every position , where you take away from , yes , you make a life repli@@ cate .
but it &apos;s very strange , but for la@@ va , what we &apos;re doing with our music language .
well , with se@@ vent@@ h , you have dreams , but not most important memor@@ ies .
it &apos;s always the same back@@ y@@ ard , but a lot of time of light , at various light .
but also , when you put it in there , it &apos;s still a little bit more technical .
or c , because you &apos;ve cla@@ im@@ ed them that they are un@@ common .
you &apos;ve got a second or a second view , how do you tell them today ?
or d , you don &apos;t like any music , and you don &apos;t want to have to have x .
the span@@ ish pain@@ ter p@@ ab@@ l &apos;s got one woman portra@@ yed portra@@ as@@ so .
this woman , after she turns out , is the portra@@ it she didn &apos;t see her that much .
but that also leads me to the point where the things are so intui@@ tive ?
she came from school one day , she &apos;s teacher , and she told them about a student .
although i &apos;m in the fire@@ men , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ cal things .
so , we are as though it &apos;s impossible to live without a sou@@ l .
and please use the word word for predi@@ ction , called prop@@ he@@ t .
that was the time that everybody was the je@@ wish was called k@@ f@@ a .
and the ti@@ tle of the talk was , as a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able .
you can only , of course , if you &apos;re in some ways or in some ways .
we are less like the same system if the same cost goes up five percent per year .
let &apos;s also be suppor@@ tive , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
now last year on this site , 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 birds , more than 250 different var@@ ie@@ ties .
oh , and by the way , at the end of it , they don &apos;t even be there .
i had some kind of a trip of the penguins , so i looked at mi@@ gu@@ el .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;ll be a better coo@@ ked than i ever &apos;ll be .
it &apos;s something like this , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
the sum@@ mar@@ i@@ ties con@@ tains a short over@@ come and a symbol of the area that comes from them .
one of the commer@@ ci@@ als of co@@ hl@@ a was that it was that .
in &apos; 5@@ 7 , five meas@@ ures occu@@ r , and made a wei@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing mistake .
their own photos will occu@@ r with meta@@ data that has a different person .
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
so i want to say , there are some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and tomorrow tomorrow , and then tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow comes tomorrow , tomorrow never comes .
and this leads to less satis@@ fac@@ tion with the results , although the results are good .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a special problem of modern , rich , western societies .
we tried different approach@@ es to simpli@@ fy it for the minim@@ um components .
and so we started with the question , could we syn@@ thes@@ i@@ ze a chromo@@ some ?
there are enzy@@ mes of the limit@@ s called the fact that we are actually going to di@@ gest dna .
it conver@@ ts co2 in me@@ than@@ e under the use of hydro@@ gen as a source of energy .
that means -- you see , i &apos;m a j@@ ung . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i think that these success pres@@ su@@ it@@ ated our artists of the past 500 years .
they were always fab@@ ul@@ ous , because the dan@@ cers were professional and they were fantastic .
what i &apos;ve all had to say is , if i &apos;m mad , it &apos;s not fear .
and then suddenly , they would recognize how it would be if they couldn &apos;t speak their own language .
there &apos;s in mem@@ bran@@ e , and in america , it &apos;s helping us grow our economy .
it &apos;s aff@@ ord@@ able , and the workers re@@ main in love and bread .
in co@@ al@@ en@@ g@@ y , we see climate change as a serious dan@@ ger for our business .
finally , the positive version of our economic challenge and our challenge is national security .
in short , a si@@ de@@ in is an inter@@ active computer in the size of a clu@@ k@@ el .
all you have to say is &quot; educ@@ ators &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
and now i collect the filter with the lights that i can control the effect of life .
extremely important is already extremely important , and much more importantly , it &apos;s going to be more important in the future .
the fourth point is that history is a place of information depen@@ dur@@ es .
there are technical concep@@ ts like aug@@ mented reality , which means the exten@@ ded reality .
yeah , kids are from nature , or should be curious , designers .
but primary media , but the language was a little more natural , something very alive .
it is that we know glob@@ ally , and more and more and better .
so , no more zer@@ os , or c@@ yp@@ tic co@@ des , it &apos;s a metaphor .
that &apos;s been a lot more used , but it &apos;s also much better than that , but it &apos;s also much better .
please watch the shape of the ice , and where he &apos;s on the water line .
and he &apos;s called the part of his cour@@ ses , the potential of human will@@ s .
it means to produce something that is the potential out of ti@@ ck@@ ons .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s very dis@@ connected .
but is there a third chance , de@@ duc@@ ing , and terrible possibility .
so here we see a young fe@@ males and males in a play play .
so let &apos;s get back to those two creatures that have happened at the beginning of the talk .
what &apos;s interesting is that the real time contro@@ ls systems start emerging in our lives .
they are 75 percent of the energy consumption -- cause up to 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
now the first project i would like to introdu@@ ce you to is actually one of the first one of our lab@@ s .
early after@@ noon , people here and there , the calls of calls , they move .
and if we were going to show that to people , then we can push a change change .
now , i should tell you what happened to you at night when all the sensor@@ s occu@@ r .
and that &apos;s the beautiful thing about creating things that are being used and interact with people .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of scre@@ ens .
it &apos;s a physical gest@@ ure in london , but with ima@@ gery .
so , what do we want to be mani@@ fest a dis@@ ab@@ led human beings or a powerful people ?
my life is really extraordinary about the work of some amazing projects .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
we set up a proje@@ ctor against a wall of park park .
you can have me as a farmer , or in le@@ ther , but no one ever vot@@ ed .
she saved my life by using me the toi@@ let in the classroom .
because when the wh@@ ales have been there and the person is there , then i open him .
and i want to tell you how we were able to get out of this code .
there is the gra@@ y box , and you see the gra@@ y box , and you see the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
he has nothing to do with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , with caus@@ ality .
so , for example , he would work exactly as well -- in a power station or a car factory .
in my view , the mo@@ s@@ sa is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so , as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we are as a brand .
we need to encoura@@ ge people not to have fear that they might change .
when i travel@@ ed , and to visit muse@@ ums , i started to learn a lot .
and so i began playing around , and i realized there &apos;s something going on there .
it has no budget , it doesn &apos;t have any protein , and scientists are building all this in it .
sounds , and it &apos;s coming back , and that &apos;s coming back to the fact that your imagination can create a reality .
well , they were highly engineering and in@@ fan@@ ten@@ ed in@@ fan@@ ts .
i &apos;ve got all these movies , these docum@@ ent@@ ary films , for a very small audience .
and this leads to star@@ vation . it leads to un@@ certain@@ ty . it leads to un@@ certain@@ ty .
i &apos;ve asked the top scientist , &quot; do we really have to get down close to zero ?
it invol@@ ves everything that we eat , clo@@ thing , television , he@@ ating .
usually , there &apos;s no de@@ ad@@ line that you need a mira@@ cle to a certain date .
well , there are all kinds of play@@ ful solutions like this , but they don &apos;t kill all much .
rather than break the head , they burn it . a great thing .
when countries are in places like cop@@ pen@@ ha@@ gen , they don &apos;t just want to talk about carbon .
and it would be good if it could take multiple , because then you could use a mix@@ ture .
care@@ ful of great kinds of break@@ through@@ s , this is the largest thing you know ?
and those of you who are interested in , you know , mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low is a visit .
they find some crazy examples from all around the world , the way people re@@ optimi@@ ze the system .
i don &apos;t want the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m an ad@@ jac@@ ent .
so i shif@@ ted that , and i took this film on the big ship that goes .
a year or so , i read a study that really has really stun@@ ned me .
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , four , five , five .
and that really begins with a fundamental response to our memor@@ ies -- it starts immediately .
and not one of these stories is very sophisti@@ cated , but one of them is clear ...
so , what a story is re@@ brea@@ ks , more fundamental insi@@ ghts and ends .
and even if we think about the future , we usually don &apos;t think about the future .
that &apos;s one of the explan@@ ations that is given for the domin@@ ance of ourselves .
and then they would ask , how happy are the vie@@ ws in life of themselves ?
so in the last year , we &apos;ve started to learn about the two kinds of self .
just to give you a taste about the cor@@ relation is about five 5 .
now , i compu@@ ted that it took time for 21 billion hours of playing time per week .
he wanted to capture the feelings of games , and so he built a camera .
here are the four things i found . first of all , there &apos;s ing@@ light optimis@@ m .
the reason is that there &apos;s a lot of trust to play a game with somebody .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we constru@@ ct those values .
we can get them to do things that they thought could &apos;t .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually share your dna .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate .
the first steps of history i &apos;ve been telling you about , a billion years ago , a billion years ago .
then the next time , as language and so on , perman@@ ent less than a million years .
but one of them is a little bit of lu@@ ck two numbers in the right order .
and with a method of re@@ mix@@ ing , anal@@ o@@ g to re@@ production . &quot;
we know that an develop@@ mental process is not opti@@ mal , when it gets too complicated .
it &apos;s faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so conf@@ using .
and i believe we all are part of the creation of what comes next .
we came to the conclu@@ sion that f@@ ence and magic was re@@ placed by machines .
a story that dis@@ pos@@ es with new aff@@ air@@ s , like the environment .
in another chap@@ ter , you have to put a piece of fu@@ el@@ in@@ ed photograph@@ er and tag .
as a doctor , you can do good things as a physi@@ cian , but you can do more .
sometimes when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
she said , &quot; well , first of all , you &apos;ll love your mom . &quot;
now , i want to talk about what that might be , this transition that we are at right now .
as a young man , i hat@@ ched the privi@@ lege , ro@@ ink par@@ ks .
when he saw me , he came over and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
every second every day , our senses catch a lot more information than our hir@@ n can ever process .
so think about that , a group of students today can change the lives of billions of people .
and if we have an energy monit@@ or , then we &apos;ll have water in ab@@ und@@ ance .
i think we need to do something about a lot of medical culture .
and over a period and a half to two hours , she started feeling better .
in a flas@@ h store , i saw two times a blind blin@@ d@@ lock of blin@@ dness .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me the symptom@@ s in the same way .
the second story is a different concept , the transforma@@ tional ta@@ il@@ en@@ vast , ger@@ man .
mr. ja@@ in himself is on free@@ zing foot , the location is un@@ known .
they &apos;re completely motiv@@ ated by something else -- about , an opini@@ on , or her audience .
they don &apos;t have to be engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful br@@ d@@ ses , beautiful buildings .
green is a copy , blue is power , p@@ ink is input , and orange wir@@ es wir@@ es wir@@ es .
they can go to the website , all design meetings , and they make them themselves .
now , to@@ sh@@ .@@ 0 was starting to write a lot of blogs on it .
what does this mean to be too vi@@ br@@ ating and not too vi@@ br@@ ating ?
and i came to the stat@@ ement that a new city has new new york people .
febru@@ ary 17@@ th was appro@@ ved to be appro@@ ved by 1@@ 14 to a voice .
you &apos;ve got a building block , and you &apos;re just talking to the second city for the second city .
one thing that you already know was already known , there are many r@@ ap@@ s .
we &apos;ve put up a little di@@ stor@@ tion directly at the end of the business .
and after that , we looked at what was the one that people bought a glass of mar@@ ker .
they &apos;re likely to make better choices -- bad money and schle@@ er medical decisions .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to count it .
and if their employees couldn &apos;t tell them , their cli@@ ents can &apos;t . &quot;
for example , this is a study that we made in a time frame of time .
and this is a lot of the time when you look at the li@@ sts of all these f@@ on@@ ds .
now , these decisions are different from the number of choices that they provide per decision .
what i &apos;m doing now is i change the order that make decisions .
rs &quot; fri@@ day &quot; is one of the most popular foot@@ age in the year .
and what if you want to see van go@@ gh , this ma@@ ster@@ piece has made this ma@@ ster@@ piece ?
as i said , one of the biggest stars -- ju@@ stin bie@@ ber -- did his beginning to youtube .
after three months of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ b@@ our@@ ne , we land@@ ed in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
&quot; do it just &quot; do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and not , what you &apos;re not . &quot;
in order to mid@@ night , the mon@@ ks came and said he f@@ ought to finish the guy .
we know exactly where all wal@@ at@@ at@@ ms are around ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht .
and my little star@@ tu@@ p , we want us to get us to conser@@ vation .
we &apos;re choo@@ sing some fel@@ lo@@ ws every year , and we do it with urban ta@@ pes .
if you &apos;re doing that , you can name a name , and it &apos;s called the first al .
this is a lot of people in the office of the new urban mechan@@ ics in boston .
i &apos;m talking about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
you can tell your mind , on every time , every time , and you do it .
i &apos;m not talking about the details of the slide , but i &apos;m talking about the gener@@ als .
but if something like this is happening here , then that changes the quality of it@@ al@@ it@@ arian circum@@ stance .
it &apos;s not possible that everything goes on forever and so quickly .
it &apos;s like that , then we &apos;re in the middle right now in the middle of a shift .
yeah , they feel it if they are hot at this point . there &apos;s something wrong .
it &apos;s about virtu@@ ality , it &apos;s about non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity , it &apos;s about a matter .
but su@@ k@@ z@@ sto@@ ve then came up with this writing as a pri@@ mar@@ medium medium .
a second circle already starts to cor@@ rel@@ ate , to cor@@ rel@@ ate and associ@@ ate .
that means that the first sen@@ su@@ s is happening in a ra@@ pid ra@@ pid speed , as we percei@@ ve things .
and that &apos;s an intui@@ tive for us to be more intui@@ tive about that .
that means that we are losing about five times more than new being educ@@ ated .
you have them to put it in their food , not for the food sta@@ irs .
now for me , and for the com@@ pos@@ er , and what they could now mean to him is true for him today .
each of your music is made by the outside , when you get through the outside of music .
i ask , you don &apos;t sing , a , because they believe they can &apos;t sing them ?
but then i &apos;d re@@ gre@@ t , because music is a beautiful , sophisti@@ cated thing .
also , by bee@@ tho@@ ven , you know that he was more listening than he has been di@@ b .
that &apos;s why the com@@ pos@@ ers are depen@@ dent on us again that rein@@ rein@@ fer@@ red the pieces .
in such a lie , you see the li@@ ars don &apos;t believe what he does .
and because i &apos;m in the fire@@ men , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ cal things .
still , we are a lot of information as an information facili@@ ty , very strong .
because he led them to a grain that he doesn &apos;t occu@@ r himself .
by the way , about a hundred gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ wat@@ ts of electric power in the world , in the world .
and that means that we &apos;ve been looking for the first bat@@ tage of the world to find the largest battery in the world .
and if you have a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able , it &apos;s like a re@@ vie@@ wer system .
then they only use what &apos;s in the sun and wind , where they live .
and the reality of that expression is coming to us all , and it &apos;s inspired by us .
and that night , i was in bed , and i thought , &quot; what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
it &apos;s now the greatest and one of the most important agri@@ cultural reser@@ ve reser@@ ve in europe .
capital , chemistry and machines are hu@@ mili@@ an , and it never really made anything good to eat .
in my school time , i went to school to school every day for an hour per hour .
it was all about attemp@@ ting to try to understand the world , and the boundar@@ ies of the possible world .
when i was growing up as an adult , it was the film@@ making .
and i thought to myself , &quot; wow , that really has to be brought into film art . &quot;
we took little robots that were built by a fi@@ ber glass ves@@ sel .
now , we colli@@ de a lot of carbon dio@@ xide , over 26 billion tons of tons .
but the same thing we &apos;re doing right now , the same approach@@ es for the development of vac@@ cin@@ es .
if i asked them to count the big world , what would they say ?
it &apos;s a photograph i took just last apri@@ l in the northern th@@ 0s .
the sister who did a lot of that was brought into a self-@@ assem@@ bly camp .
this is a reali@@ stic case . this is a copy of the guar@@ di@@ an .
all of these photographs are inter@@ connected , and there &apos;s something bigger than the sum of the parts .
and what it &apos;s doing is bringing people into the business and ask the question .
the doctor says a number and risks and b and b has those benefits and risks .
and that &apos;s not because they are less bat@@ t@@ less , and not because they are less specific .
with so many oper@@ ations that you can choose , it will be very difficult to deci@@ de people at all .
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment fund , or even the wrong sal@@ at@@ d@@ lock .
and the sal@@ es said , &quot; do you want to sna@@ p up , squ@@ ir@@ si@@ fy or over@@ head ?
they &apos;re never going to be stun@@ t@@ led because their expec@@ tations , my expec@@ tations , our expec@@ tations .
with 100 different kinds of je@@ ans in the jung@@ le , there &apos;s no exc@@ use for failure .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we tried to get the process a little more quickly .
now we have the opportunity to build a large robot that can create millions of chromo@@ som@@ es a day .
it &apos;s a tool that can find the sou@@ l of a particular culture in material world .
i think that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be done by using re@@ mix@@ es of vac@@ cin@@ es in it .
the question i &apos;d like to ask you today is : is this an idea for you in all right ?
she felt when it came , because it would take the earth under their feet .
but then i remem@@ ber@@ ed the way that tom had been talking to the open hea@@ v@@ ens , and i tried .
okay . but , if you don &apos;t do that , you know what the he@@ ck is doing with it .
when it happened then , people knew what was happening . they called it in his name .
on the other end of the planet , ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , the largest ice mass on the planet .
in california , there was a 40 percent redu@@ ction in the si@@ de@@ ens of si@@ er@@ ra .
this exchange in the world leads to a dra@@ matic increase in fire .
look carefully at this , this is the today , clean food technology .
and the si@@ de-@@ off@@ s are an example of a new generation of tools to manipu@@ late digital data .
you need , of course , biological materials , and you also need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
and our approach was to say o@@ .@@ k , that actually you don &apos;t need to do that .
and i would invi@@ te everyone to compe@@ te and explore myself even as a matter of them .
the interesting thing about this is that at the time of human produ@@ cers , media produ@@ cer was media produ@@ cer and medium itself .
i &apos;m just going to show you a couple of examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and to force .
they call that &quot; stre@@ i@@ ci@@ le &quot; in the united states , we call that &quot; tracking . &quot;
and the one students are te@@ hr@@ it@@ ely pus@@ hing the teachers together , and then the teachers are getting together .
but anyway , they are a wonderful environment for the bacteria , just like they care about their lives .
let &apos;s first look at the reality that people are making decisions over their lives .
in the good part of the bad guys , and as soon as they think about , these decisions are going to be on us .
in the fra@@ ction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement of my clo@@ se@@ ens .
you have to go up to the fire , and you have to get a few shoes over , and you have to get a pair of shoes . &quot;
service in a des@@ k@@ top , smo@@ oth a park in the neighborhood .
first of all , bon@@ o@@ bo@@ -@@ type -- and i don &apos;t think about foot@@ ball .
that could be the evolutionary orig@@ in of : &quot; you pack it in the eg@@ gs . &quot;
i worked with people who were working smaller , so people who were smaller than usual .
women , like men , have something called ad@@ ren@@ al@@ in@@ al lim@@ bs .
for example , we go to the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanze@@ es .
and it makes me ten@@ se in terms of thinking about the democracy .
over the cities , all of this true sense of the world is taking place in the practice of the everyday life .
the real importance of the word &quot; fin@@ der@@ ly . &quot;
and this is what brought us to thinking about this project that i &apos;m showing you now .
they say that all things are shown up there , a life cycle of life .
and then he said three words -- the lo@@ se@@ sts that i &apos;ve ever heard .
more than anything , everything else is my only goal in life , a good father .
the gra@@ y bo@@ x that you see here is real time contro@@ ls systems .
and so the film will look at this whole idea -- which is , in infin@@ ity , forever ?
technology is not the way you want to describe something that someone &apos;s doing under the se@@ ats .
8@@ 0s re@@ vi@@ val occu@@ pi@@ ed on sc@@ at@@ tery , except the was@@ on .
i think the gene , the style i have , is &quot; kind of &quot; rever@@ se . &quot;
just tell me a little bit how this is connected to your thinking and feelings about themselves .
i feel that we have to encoura@@ ge people to take risks .
i even come to one of my favorite , the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan museum in art in new york .
that didn &apos;t really mean my intuition , and maybe just because i wasn &apos;t playing games with particles .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be concep@@ tu@@ alized as we think about economic development .
so , we met ourselves in dec@@ ember of a hotel in mi@@ ami .
now , that &apos;s a direct conflict between the living self and the memory self .
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their school work under the street .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , is finally good news .
is there a natural illusion , a dem@@ o that shows the idea of people here ?
now , let &apos;s go to the goal that we have to talk about , and then we talk about the mean@@ time .
we need to introdu@@ ce not@@ ute meas@@ ures to try to make the earth@@ temper@@ able temper@@ atures ?
cli@@ ma@@ tors : do you have one or two sent@@ ences for that to convince you ?
and that is that b@@ w@@ l students were trained to find a real plan , ok !
so , there are deep media lessons for us , the nature of power and success .
and listen , each one &apos;s got a right to think about it , even right to the idea of progress .
and that , although nei@@ ther any pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical -- it &apos;s just too sugar .
that creates a very strong picture in the head that &apos;s very much stron@@ ger than a white p@@ ill .
this ch@@ art is really ... i &apos;m going to show you a different time , if we have a proje@@ ctor .
and these are two very different concep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both immer@@ sed in the idea of happiness .
and then he ad@@ ded down , actually quite emotion@@ ally , that all the experience has ru@@ ined .
but now there &apos;s another question , &quot; how much did this patient tell her ? &quot;
so let &apos;s watch each factor , and look at how we get to zero .
this is going to lead to the fact that the patient is suffering , but only a little bit less than that .
people are looking at that they should be thinking about happiness , if they think about politics .
in the united states , you &apos;ve come to measure the experience of the population of the population .
well , sa@@ dly , we tend to see this face in the real life , when we solve hard problems .
and i found some things that the epi@@ c se@@ ens are doing as possible .
we &apos;re so good at doing whatever the most important people in the world are doing .
so many people have been in the world at least one hour per day with online games per day .
and in the next decade , we have another billion player who are extraordinary , whatever .
so scientists recently came to mind that this is the o@@ dor@@ ot@@ us &apos; mad story actually .
this super@@ computer is called global mortality , of course , of course .
we &apos;re working with universi@@ ties across sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa , and they store them to learn more social transforma@@ tions .
and dr. p@@ . always was very color@@ ful , and it was just like being created with kids like this .
and i looked around and i see the older man . i had no idea who he is .
when i first saw her , i took her mother her mother . &quot;
and that &apos;s what happens because i &apos;ve seen something with my legs and not despite the experience .
and in the course of the next eight or nine days , they spent the s@@ ession .
a policy of fear and an@@ ger has convinced us that these problems aren &apos;t our problems .
we want to create li@@ fel@@ ong sent@@ ences with children &apos;s li@@ ve@@ li@@ hood for children .
and because that &apos;s the way , there &apos;s a basic human dig@@ ni@@ ty that has to respect the law .
that we are not fully developed as human beings as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and foundation .
so the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala is our early war@@ ning systems , our bi@@ ased dete@@ ctor .
and the old ada@@ pt , &quot; if it &apos;s flo@@ wing , the demand is very true .
steve pin@@ ker showed us that we live in a very pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful time of human history .
how many of you saw the vic@@ tory of ib@@ m super@@ -@@ computer wat@@ son at risk ?
because the sc@@ ar@@ ce is con@@ tex@@ tual , and technology is a resource free .
this is the story of na@@ po@@ le@@ on i@@ i@@ i@@ d in the middle of the 18@@ 0@@ 0s .
and he knew her , he would be able to contribu@@ te in the ability to contribu@@ te to her .
she was born around 18@@ 80 , and the experience of sla@@ very was her world very strong .
the healthy way that i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes one in the inner@@ -@@ inner@@ -@@ e@@ yed disease .
he received in@@ tra@@ ven@@ a , and he re@@ turned a few days later .
when have you heard the last time you heard about mis@@ mis@@ si@@ pers about mis@@ mis@@ si@@ pers ?
because i &apos;ve been studying it as i went to college in 197@@ 1 .
and i got a bad sun@@ fire and i believe that i really wasn &apos;t going to live from there .
in the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- at the beginning of the &apos; 6@@ 0s , europe pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly pro@@ mote a lot of develop@@ mental programs .
we ada@@ pt our intui@@ tions , and we don &apos;t call ourselves in memory , which was there .
over time , it changes . it changes , because the people are very common .
these are mat@@ the@@ w ander@@ son , t@@ ari@@ q al da@@ our and so on .
cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ating ha@@ cks and fa@@ iled cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
it has an ap@@ p , a web@@ apple ap@@ p , called &quot; the &quot; fin@@ s . &quot;
and they discovered that the average ce@@ o was working on the week at 13@@ 9 tas@@ ks .
this ch@@ art shows how it looked like the video was popular last summer .
already in the first seven days , there was a par@@ o@@ id for every single week .
what &apos;s important is that creativity in the internet of technology and ge@@ e@@ ks .
two pieces of gri@@ m for school , each , to cover the holes in the other .
so to get a reali@@ stic out@@ come , it &apos;s made from me out of the planning .
and if you make good images , the out@@ come can be quite beautiful , and also quite reali@@ stic .
i &apos;d like to talk to them about why so many electr@@ onic health projects are missing missing .
and one of the things that we did , i want to share with you a little video .
that &apos;s where you usually come out , when you reti@@ re in your city 3@@ 11 feet .
so what is it for an idea to think about this in hon@@ dur@@ as &apos;s new city ?
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is in the crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
one of the most important things is that , in fact , government is not the same as politics .
now , why do we draw gra@@ m in the technology of se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ve ?
because the transi@@ tion seems very , very conf@@ using when you &apos;re in the middle of it .
i think the cause is that we realize that there &apos;s anything in the gan@@ g .
i think that makes sense when you divi@@ de it in a couple of billi@@ on-@@ dollar steps .
your skin cells are use without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
i &apos;ve got a very complicated , extraordinary and conf@@ using idea in my head .
i think it &apos;s very we@@ ak to tell us that we are the end product of evolution .
when i was a little girl , my grand@@ father gave me a little sil@@ ver bag watch .
and the pre@@ cis@@ es were enormous , and we needed to build c@@ ameras and all sorts of things .
but we know , if we &apos;re talking about that , social propor@@ tions are very sensitive .
and what we &apos;re going to see almost every day in the daily newspaper that you &apos;ll find in this third sentence .
so , in the mode of shif@@ ting evidence , you see the great gap of the gap .
but not , we are in europe in seven percent , and our net is physi@@ cally the european .
we just wanted to know what is a regular , regular electro@@ chemical battery .
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve cra@@ w@@ ned the ocean as we &apos;ve be@@ aten the law@@ ods .
so it &apos;s probably going to be gri@@ m or gri@@ m , fis@@ her@@ ic , a part of our future .
that means that 15 pounds of viet@@ fish are requi@@ red to get a po@@ und tun@@ a .
in front of the day , i called the bo@@ w of public health work for the fir@@ m .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t know what &apos;s sustainable about hi@@ ding chi@@ ck@@ ens ? &quot;
instead of pul@@ ling the water out , they used the chan@@ n@@ els to pull water back .
they do that because they can follow the united king@@ dom of the land in a@@ 9@@ 2 .
no , not because we already produce enough cal@@ ories to feed the world more than just fe@@ eding .
or better , how can we design conditions that are capable of fe@@ eding themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agri@@ cultural industri@@ es for the future .
they need these lying to susta@@ in a li@@ ve@@ li@@ hood to get a self-@@ de@@ mis@@ e .
and so you see the animals that are right next to 500 degrees c that they can survive there .
but at the end of the day , i went to the world that i took space scientist with us in the deep sea .
so three very difficult problems that might be more solu@@ ble , and that &apos;s why you should work .
one is that the power that these technologies are producing dra@@ matically lower than power plants .
bill gro@@ ss has a number of companies , among other people , who have found the great solar ther@@ mal technologies .
i &apos;m optimi@@ stic . you know , french people and japanese are made in the direction .
you put a team together on the team , you &apos;ll get signific@@ antly better .
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge is , she helps them identify the assu@@ mp@@ tions .
and the fundamental lesson , i believe , is actually a comp@@ ens@@ able sport .
i believe that you kind of rel@@ ate to no@@ stal@@ gi@@ ty .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to har@@ m the world green .
but these artic@@ les were really worried , and i couldn &apos;t find out why , and finally i found out .
we are at one point where we don &apos;t have the same propor@@ tion for progress as before .
if paul is speaking in a public setting , he cannot say without ar@@ med wat@@ ers .
that &apos;s the planet where we live . don &apos;t pre@@ tend that it isn &apos;t .
but now there &apos;s a mu@@ d , new solution to en@@ able us from this ab@@ und@@ ant position .
and that &apos;s an idea that , if you think about it , you can only do with hope .
but what makes vo@@ o@@ do@@ o so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
whether he &apos;s a conc@@ ern of a mind or a whole bunch of reasons is ir@@ relevant .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering if you haven &apos;t seen it sub@@ mis@@ si@@ ble at the bottom level .
something as deep as our identity is now a matter of choice , like this slide to show .
i teach myself a wonderful intelligent teaching students , and i &apos;ll give them 20 percent less work than i used to .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new york , i &apos;m sorry .
but the more i thought about that , the more i thought that the fish came to mind .
it actually took some years starting with a bio@@ eth@@ ic re@@ view before we did the first experiments .
that was our first time , starting with the digital information , ph@@ i x 17@@ 4 .
so think about this : we have a 4@@ -@@ letter code : a , c , g and t .
and what i want to do is , i want to give you a lot of what i &apos;m going to do for some of the jobs here , and vice .
in a sense , the arc@@ tic of the arc@@ tic of the global climate system is the sum of our global climate system .
already today in a couple of flat la@@ kes in al@@ as@@ ka me@@ than@@ e , of itself from the water .
and one reason is that this vast war@@ ning p@@ ye@@ v@@ ei@@ llan@@ ce comes from north .
but interesting is the unique clay cloud of the ly@@ de , the rhyth@@ m of dance in every culture .
if they are outside , they &apos;ll notice you can see that , and you can get some nervous .
by sha@@ king the si@@ de@@ walk and the side side , he can interact the characters ...
in those arch@@ a@@ ic models , we heard that we have a natural propor@@ tion to virtu@@ ality .
what is this with the virtual virtu@@ ality that is actually the most natural thing in the world .
virtu@@ ality is suddenly alien to us , and has nothing to do with reality anymore .
it sounds very spac@@ ing and sounds like science fi@@ ction , i know .
they &apos;ll never forget it , because i &apos;m going to show you where the d@@ al@@ mati@@ an is .
because the phosp@@ hor@@ us is ex@@ posed to the pi@@ cks are ex@@ posed to ex@@ pos@@ ure parts .
in china , a neighb@@ or is still talking about hon@@ ey sound p@@ ills , right ?
and they are designed , through design , a farmer that can simply afford them .
you understand , there are two countries that control nearly 20 percent of the phosp@@ hor@@ us worldwide .
so , it &apos;s about creating a large foot@@ print that will get a we@@ t@@ lands .
a television or a car machine that uses them only , they don &apos;t use them .
an example of a very different area , mon@@ et has pain@@ ted x-@@ twice .
and the kid plays , rather than a break , rather than a red flo@@ wer .
either bat@@ m@@ fusion , or a &quot; par@@ ad@@ ise wind , &quot; they &apos;ll have the choice .
our cities , in the last few years , just working with networks and electr@@ on@@ ics .
now look at what happened this day , just obser@@ ving activity that &apos;s happening in the network .
when these scre@@ ens fall down , they can write out patterns , images , text , text .
no , they haven &apos;t destro@@ yed the building , it &apos;s just that architecture nearly disappe@@ ars .
imagine the screen could just appear in different forma@@ ts or si@@ zes , different resol@@ ution .
if you turn up the lights , it looks like this , so the same as we saw it before .
this can be , in our case , that we use it to create a symbol and create a symbol .
so , i &apos;m writing for children , and i &apos;m likely to be most of america &apos;s most common child writer .
it needs truth , and beauty , and i &apos;m so gla@@ d that this has been talking today .
and after that , i thought about that , i decided to lose negative energy from my life .
as we rus@@ h , i had that feeling , man , to die is not terri@@ fying .
what would you do that , because they think they would be there forever ?
so , for example , 16@@ 4 sti@@ cks out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
we need digital security systems , where a human machine cannot re@@ act fast enough .
i thought , &quot; well , put the camera out of the word that we wanted to have a back@@ -@@ class dialo@@ gue .
fri@@ day : a universal truth -- five words : gol@@ en pa@@ ir@@ le@@ ts ada@@ pt to everything .
how can we keep it fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three times fro@@ zen .
if dan were a brand , he would be a classi@@ c mer@@ ce@@ des of diam@@ rio .
man 2 : the brand i &apos;m , is , i would say , there &apos;s no por@@ es .
they &apos;re a up@@ -@@ at@@ tri@@ c ? are they the blood in w@@ wo@@ ods ?
just to give you a little zo@@ om out , i want you to see what you get .
and that &apos;s a great concep@@ tual model of the world , so long as you don &apos;t have a partic@@ le physi@@ ci@@ sts .
this is the first object that you can see in quant@@ um mechan@@ ical position .
you hear a lot of just a bunch of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics that everything is connected to everything .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they are so much more worth building them .
now that sounds now for you , so@@ cially you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
by part of the const@@ it@@ ution , it needs to be appro@@ ved twice through con@@ gress .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you a couple of questions , and i want to share your answers .
they &apos;ve heard it before , but it never true as true today that less is more .
the one on the left is ja@@ zz and the one on the right is s@@ wing , but you know what ?
the categ@@ ories have to tell the choices , not the choices that make them much .
he understood that the medical diagno@@ sis , and as somebody else is about two different things .
we don &apos;t want to encoura@@ ge people to eat this ro@@ t@@ ated stuff like the meta@@ ops .
so we also understand each other , so i want to show you a fundamental , simple magic trick .
i &apos;ve been studying him from the cu@@ d@@ fold in the 197@@ 0s .
and if you want to have the ulti@@ mate plac@@ ement effect , you want to take a need@@ le .
this is really my fl@@ es@@ h . it &apos;s not ste@@ at@@ ti@@ ans &apos;s cu@@ e meat .
is this something that you can share with , because now you have a couple of minutes left ?
this is , i think , in the next decade or two , to be part of the national stati@@ stic .
and in reality , if we fail when we hit failure , we often feel different .
they &apos;ve heard of &quot; level up &quot; and &quot; + 1 strength &quot; or &quot; + 1 an intelligence . &quot;
so , what we &apos;ve got here is a complete generation of young people who are ma@@ ster@@ -@@ players .
these are our ma@@ ster@@ i@@ le players , 500 million people who are extraordinary to something .
so i started thinking about what it &apos;s like to make these games .
players love it , part of the mis@@ sions of the mis@@ sions .
i really hope that we play more important games to survive on this planet another century .
you can &apos;t point out enough how significant this factor of the quality of life can be a human .
it &apos;s absolutely incredible , and dis@@ par@@ ked selves , who can afford to afford .
they help from essential food products , and they protect them against certain diseases .
or are we going to be something else -- something that may even be better to the environment ?
but at the time , as a million organisms , things began to change .
and that &apos;s the argument that the whe@@ els of evolution are slow , but they are in@@ tra@@ c@@ table .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family choo@@ ses .
so we thought we could start writing a completely new chap@@ ter in mo@@ bility .
i was the second volunte@@ er at the sur@@ hole , so i was pretty good chan@@ ces in it .
don &apos;t just wait to make a difference in another life , until you &apos;ve reach@@ ed your first million .
for us , and it &apos;s fundamental to the atta@@ ch@@ ment of the relationships and the care of toler@@ ance .
for bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and human beings , life doesn &apos;t make life out of their lives and sound alone .
in this case , i worked with people who have social people who have social nor@@ ms question .
and the side ax@@ es represent and@@ ro@@ gene , which is vi@@ ri@@ vi@@ zing hor@@ mon@@ es .
now , you might assu@@ me that this whole categ@@ ories could make a lot of people who would really make me happy .
and as part of it , they made us a concept of an@@ atom@@ ic common@@ s .
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the stupid question i &apos;ve ever heard .
the new day they took them -- wife pr@@ inter@@ s , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you have to do the sound of the wind , squ@@ ee@@ ze them and read the rest of the book .
i spend most of my time with people in research research , prison or death cells .
and sometimes when it comes to ted , it makes a meaning and the strength that otherwise don &apos;t have it .
we want to fight pre@@ occu@@ pa@@ tion and dis@@ crimin@@ ation in crimin@@ al frame@@ work .
during the past three decades , the crime rate in america is in@@ san@@ e .
and i believe that our current be@@ ams are not helping anybody .
so mal@@ tribu@@ mp . speak@@ er : dangerous cros@@ sing ves@@ sel@@ s .
also , in spi@@ te of its log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic , they lost up on the left .
three billion new heads that we &apos;ve never heard before are global communic@@ ations .
before i come to the actual subject of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little bit of baseball .
it creates a kind of a social network around a digital colle@@ ction of photos that actually recor@@ ded .
in either case , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was no trees in their treatment .
these are strong sub@@ sets , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as we should .
within a year , in a year , it comes up and begins with the commercial fis@@ her@@ es .
we want to get things that are disappe@@ ared or things that are no longer like they were .
because obviously , an animal that suff@@ ered it very often , even before it dies .
here , i think the art and the film may fill the gap , simu@@ late those simu@@ lations .
and the color sound , and you might remember , &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar . &quot;
and that was an example of what our own governments are using technology for us , the citizens .
the second largest demo@@ graphic that we can see today is not motiv@@ ated by money .
put a extra effect on an extra effect , and they made a noise machine .
that &apos;s because government is a higher ocean , and politics are the top 15@@ -@@ meter .
michael j@@ . nel@@ son &apos;s from myster@@ y science theater was one of the first things that made a jo@@ ke on twitter .
the next puzz@@ le is a bit of a boat in the early morning re@@ lief of florida .
for them , their life had put her a job : the cur@@ se of their family and a new life in australia .
and the next thing is about four women in three generations that are combin@@ ed to build a new life .
at the end of a day , i was doing a huge top sou@@ p that we shared .
you might think that it &apos;s just a land image , and the bottom part was mani@@ pul@@ ated .
there &apos;s this little blood pressure measu@@ come that goes on to an iphone or so close .
it &apos;s probably the small@@ est of the 21 app@@ s that have written the bri@@ bes in the last year .
if you know something about government technologies , you know that it &apos;s usually not happening .
it was about a method that parents can find out the right public school school for their children .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the sequence in this information .
they &apos;re not fighting this fight that we all strug@@ ger to speak , they &apos;re all being able to speak .
now , i &apos;m an opti@@ m@@ ist , so i think this is something like this .
and they developed special structures which didn &apos;t do anything else as information within the organis@@ m .
so , as an example , the most common version of this communication is the human language .
and what we actually did , we , humanity , is ourselves too abstra@@ ct .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explo@@ sion of this explo@@ sive cur@@ ve .
it allows us to produce a much larger complexity than the regular metho@@ d@@ ologi@@ es would allow them to produce .
i came up with it as though we were going to draw our lo@@ cks and c@@ ameras out of it .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children in the natural world with their technology .
as a child , i had colle@@ cted a colle@@ ction of sti@@ cks , and go@@ od@@ s and mu@@ tations .
immediately , you &apos;ll be able to understand one , for gran@@ ted , that you can &apos;t prove it .
what &apos;s important for the designers , they have the first se@@ me@@ ster , the surprising fig@@ ures .
so the first thing that sounds really ban@@ al is , but it &apos;s very exciting when you get closer to it .
that i &apos;m just doing that , and that &apos;s not what it does is not mean that it &apos;s better man@@ hab@@ le .
i mean , now , inter@@ acting with this object , i can zo@@ om out again , zo@@ om in zo@@ om .
in exten@@ sion , for example 20 percent of the g@@ arb@@ age is 20 percent of the g@@ arb@@ age treat@@ ments .
i don &apos;t usually want to help it , but maybe they can help the fr@@ a@@ gers out of it a little bit .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed an ir@@ on bag , which is a temperature temperature .
and that &apos;s half of the world &apos;s water problems that are caus@@ ed through the tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
so , for the learning process of music , you need at least as much as for spo@@ ken language language .
well , you see , all the cases have to be a dir@@ ty can@@ di@@ date .
i want to talk to you about this mechan@@ ism today , or something else , which is un@@ conscious about them .
here &apos;s what we need to understand what we &apos;re understanding of the police cor@@ stre@@ t@@ ness .
she heard about this book from the book of charles darwin who emer@@ ged species and the des@@ k of human beings .
we need to prevent people &apos;s knowledge of knowledge , especially if they are true .
a third sentence that appe@@ ars immediately to people who have a strong sense of a sou@@ l .
this is something that &apos;s called shape laws or some ex@@ pos@@ ure science that affec@@ ts us again in perception .
here we see this again , again , the same one here , again , a single ag@@ car@@ gate .
so many people and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
i certainly would never have been able to do an alien world with a spac@@ ec@@ raft . that seemed quite likely to me .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got two years later to face than we went to california .
so here &apos;s a very fundamental device at home , so you can read the home@@ work ?
i remin@@ ded myself last year when i took mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to , and somehow people liked that .
you have reas@@ sur@@ ed to me that they don &apos;t actually cut them . they don &apos;t even cut the glass .
and they also have -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need a fuel -- they have some products .
you see that it &apos;s a sort of a p@@ ill@@ ar , often known as &quot; walking wave respon@@ ses . &quot;
this is the de@@ ad@@ line that shows us the environmental models that we need to hold .
it would have been that without the creation of it , but the power it makes it much more important .
there &apos;s a flu@@ id re@@ actor that seems to be a little bit difficult , but maybe the people that tell us about us .
they say that there &apos;s some negative impli@@ cations to do that with the clou@@ ds that make things different ?
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing a lifest@@ yle .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i &apos;ve trans@@ formed it into a design work@@ shop .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to watch them go into the next century .
his mother became a jo@@ ti@@ ment , as pun@@ ish@@ ment for being weal@@ thy .
and it &apos;s ti@@ ring to think that our species might exist for 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 years .
the man was not terri@@ fied in the arc@@ tic night or the hur@@ ting stor@@ m .
and this really rais@@ es these ideas , these limit@@ ations to the exi@@ sting location on the screen .
we hope that we don &apos;t need po@@ p-@@ u@@ ps and other non@@ sense -- that should not be necessary .
we &apos;ve now become an infin@@ ite sele@@ ction of tele@@ phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
instead , they go to the doctor and the do@@ c tells them to do that , we could do b , or we could do b .
and by the way , there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m going to tell you about , which i &apos;m going to work on .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we mis@@ sed a lot at the time that we use our shared life .
if you break the gold glass so that everything is possible , you can get the satis@@ fac@@ tion .
so , this is almost too successful -- maybe for the fish , definitely for us .
we &apos;ve been able to elimin@@ ate about a hundred genes from the 500 or so , which are here .
so we had to create a new way of building these little bits together , and they could cor@@ rect the er@@ ror .
the vi@@ ral particles were then rele@@ ased from the cells , and came back and killed e@@ .@@ d. . co@@ ke .
if we think about biological processes , or any process to replace that , it will become a huge challenge .
we use this fab@@ ul@@ ous eu@@ p@@ he@@ mis@@ m attemp@@ t and er@@ ror , which turns out to be meaning@@ less .
the gre@@ e@@ ks called the go@@ d-@@ o@@ o@@ di@@ ous tra@@ w@@ ler of creativity will occu@@ r .
that &apos;s great . the tube didn &apos;t really think that a geni@@ us was a particularly smart individual .
maybe to become an aging understanding of the relationship between people and myster@@ y .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper ; he has no pen@@ cil , he doesn &apos;t have a ta@@ pe record .
but again , very r@@ ar@@ ely happened , something special happened . one of the fol@@ ters was actually trans@@ formed .
40 percent of all the people around the world are getting half of their drin@@ king water out of this mel@@ ting water .
this question was so up@@ setting that we decided to explain the answer to the answer and si@@ de@@ walk .
that &apos;s a game with words that are a kind of mix@@ ture of sc@@ rab@@ ble and bo@@ g@@ gling .
i can acceler@@ ate the whole sequence by the p@@ ace in one way or another direction .
and so from interest , in this technology , i went back to this technology .
we can &apos;t answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen now , and it &apos;s just happening right now .
i &apos;ve brought you an example of the northern american tri@@ be of no@@ ot@@ ka@@ -@@ indi@@ ans .
all that takes the ability to accept our basic ability , virtu@@ ality as a real life habit@@ at .
that &apos;s a whole series of things that you &apos;re facing next to the ow@@ ner@@ al existence .
because often people are people , they can &apos;t use it , so anybody can deal with it .
we want you to tell a story , but we only want you to tell our history . &quot;
what are we going to start with the fact that we are only dist@@ ingu@@ ishing ourselves through a few nu@@ clear@@ o@@ ti@@ des ?
the green fa@@ thers were from my sight , and that &apos;s why it is that it &apos;s that .
well , just to conclu@@ de , i want to conclu@@ de by saying i &apos;ve been talking a lot about the fa@@ thers .
it &apos;s almost physi@@ ologi@@ cally impossible to be bad if you wear bright red pants .
if you &apos;re surro@@ unded with the right people , you &apos;ll not only understand it , you &apos;ll also appreci@@ ate it .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn about this week is that it &apos;s okay to let it go .
my heart , i was s@@ mil@@ ing , as i tried to sum@@ mar@@ ize what was happening in front of myself .
so basically , i &apos;m about to say , if you look at something that is impossible , then you can do it .
and that sa@@ dness was really challen@@ ging in a mind , which is that i wish only one thing to wish .
i received another gift , which is to look back to the future , and come back and live differently .
these gra@@ y bo@@ x doesn &apos;t run with wind@@ mil@@ ls software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
here &apos;s a really cool stuff that we discovered -- i really came up with the so@@ bs .
the idea of this is obviously not just the machine services in the control room .
so maybe we &apos;ll sell a sho@@ ot , and it &apos;s the great sho@@ ot that you &apos;ve ever wor@@ e ...
who knows that when the film comes out , we might look like a hor@@ de vol@@ li@@ di@@ ots .
that means that we have a common ance@@ stry , an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
so doing things like this -- you know , people remem@@ ber@@ ed in ban -- that &apos;s sort of why we are interested in .
if someone asked them to describe their brand identity , their brand person@@ ality , how would they be ?
now , mor@@ gan , in the name of the transpar@@ ency , this is what happens to the $ 7@@ 100 ?
i &apos;m going to start with the dem@@ o , and i &apos;m going to tell you some interesting things that happened since the beginning .
so , i &apos;m so sick of one of my favorite pain@@ t@@ ings of ri@@ gi@@ d in the cam@@ el .
so we could very easily be filled with du@@ el , perhaps even hundreds of new cities .
also recently , ce@@ os was done with ce@@ os , in which they &apos;ve been watching the ce@@ os for a week for a week .
they &apos;re sho@@ ot@@ ing the decision -- push them up , even if it comes against their own best interest .
they kind of got their time to find english and it@@ -@@ quali@@ fi@@ cations .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privi@@ le@@ ments , in front of ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence .
so to me , it seemed like the photograph@@ y to go to the right place at the right place at the right place .
so we &apos;re li@@ f@@ ting our brains , because our brain doesn &apos;t mean that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
so it &apos;s all tools , and the only thing that re@@ fra@@ ces us is our imagination is our imagination .
and i think the most important thing is that we stopped talking to our patients .
make ways to use the light , and start to hu@@ g patients in the team to hu@@ g patients .
because if we could find that out , we would never have been able to do it before , we would never have been there before .
in the rich world there are diseases like a million us even threat to a generation , har@@ dly .
vac@@ cin@@ es , modern medicine , our ability to feed , are the numbers of the scientific method .
sa@@ dly , it &apos;s all the good news , because there &apos;s a couple of other problems , and they often mentioned .
people are hi@@ ding in their faith , and that is that you can &apos;t free them .
and that &apos;s because these imag@@ in@@ als , which made me crazy at all , had no fan@@ a@@ tics at all .
but now it &apos;s : if you have to get evidence of this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and that &apos;s going to be worse , and pretty soon children die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
there &apos;s nothing like that in my an@@ es@@ hi@@ p , or comes out , no tri@@ ck@@ le , and you can study everything .
we know from this study that you need to pick up the need@@ le when it &apos;s supposed to go .
our memory is telling us stories that say what we should be able to preser@@ ve from our experience .
so we have remin@@ ded ourselves and the living self , and they are quite different .
now , if i &apos;ve ever been opening up with the 600 pictures of it , i spent another hour of hours .
so if you want to measure the happiness of the self , you &apos;ll end up doing different things .
but actually , my research at the institute is the center of the center , the opposite is just the contr@@ ary .
you don &apos;t sit around and turn it around , and there are always some important things to do .
like us , what peter told us is not only the highest to@@ wers , but the most interesting structures of all .
we know we as human beings work opti@@ mal when we have hard , major work .
they were playing a di@@ stor@@ tion , and they went to an ep@@ ic ad@@ vent@@ ure for an ad@@ oles@@ cent ad@@ vent@@ ure .
but if you are in an ad@@ vent@@ ure ad@@ vent@@ ure , you say , &quot; we &apos;re all going to be oil . &quot;
i found out that i spent a lot of time in this hospital , which was great -- except my physi@@ ologi@@ c therapy .
and maybe we &apos;ll know , from which wood we &apos;re really ex@@ hau@@ sted , if we really test it .
and i said , &quot; exc@@ use me , we know what ? i can &apos;t remember her . &quot;
the human part of this book , far at the end , is , of course , what we &apos;re most interested in the most .
and that also represents the sub@@ mer@@ ity of that speech , so i hope you enjo@@ yed it .
now , when i was a ne@@ cking on college , i had my first bi@@ ologi@@ c classroom .
evolution is everything on the process of the genome to the next generation , adap@@ table and survival generation generation .
they can change the cells in their bodies , but what if they could change the cells of their sti@@ cks ?
why don &apos;t we have the fast muscle ves@@ sel@@ s that will allow them to run faster and longer ?
let &apos;s use a society to make a society that is better , more friend@@ ly ?
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then raise my strength and ex@@ pli@@ c@@ it .
and by the way , it &apos;s been for 500 years , as i say , very successful .
police police off@@ ic@@ ers came in and bu@@ ried pro@@ sper@@ al fore@@ sts and office services .
it &apos;s esti@@ ma@@ ted that over 400 billion ro@@ cks were produced , or 75 ro@@ st@@ les for every person on this planet .
when i went back to 27 years later , the fish went down to half of his size .
if i put in a room -- like now , i have no idea what you think about me .
in high school times a fellow fellow said that brian gold@@ mann would learn to learn a blu@@ el .
i &apos;m going to put myself on a stati@@ stic that i hope most of you have already heard of .
and to win , the device has to make a better diagno@@ sis than a team of highly sk@@ ill@@ ed physi@@ cians .
let us look at what we &apos;ve been able to do in the last century , so we can see the development .
so if we look at the news , we pre@@ fer to think about negative news .
fam@@ ine in som@@ alia -- fam@@ ine in som@@ alia .
most of the mass of mass dis@@ orders in this country didn &apos;t really exist in the main@@ stream of violence .
this re@@ ference is going to occu@@ r the money in more security and sec@@ ure .
we &apos;ve developed an ap@@ p for la@@ y@@ ar , aug@@ mented reality to find this e@@ e@@ ds .
but after all , i decided that my god , i &apos;ve got to go into the court and this crazy case .
because in this context , we &apos;re starting to gras@@ p truly amazing things that make us .
in this country , for children , we have a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence with no dom@@ esti@@ c sentence .
i wish my mother , so i said , &quot; yeah , ma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could have ever been able to write from hand .
now , re@@ produ@@ tional all the rema@@ ins , the numbers on the best .
we say , &quot; computers , gener@@ ic please , are rand@@ om@@ ly random numbers of in@@ struc@@ tions .
and we inst@@ end an evolutionary process in the machine , which is in the micro@@ se@@ p area .
so in other words , the future has been cr@@ as@@ hed by a year since i went to this world .
and as many people , i thought that in government , it &apos;s all about choo@@ sing people in an am@@ t .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far you can take a piece of future there .
so that &apos;s how if i would say , &quot; your kid , &quot; it only got three times more than five times less .
every year we lose three million tons of tons of phosp@@ hor@@ us , which has really got to go back in cir@@ cles .
in h@@ oll@@ and , you understand that , because in h@@ oll@@ and , the land is built on flo@@ wers .
because the bottom is going to die the mo@@ se , and the wind and the water was@@ hes the ground away .
and it con@@ tains see@@ ds of rare plants , so you can throw them through the ar@@ ten@@ ing bio@@ diversity .
there are extra dimensions , cra@@ d@@ t-@@ to-@@ cra@@ d@@ lock , where everyone can do with each other .
his concern@@ s , to write the piece , will be more and more and more to my personal los@@ ses , to play it .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some color li@@ ts out of it , but for new appli@@ cations .
so when i come , with my little v pi@@ le pi@@ le , and i &apos;m going to point out this emotion .
no , the gap i &apos;m talking about is that they dec@@ ei@@ ve themselves .
but there are no ver@@ bs that we can see where you learn how to make fire .
and that &apos;s just creating the words that we use in the language of poli@@ tically cor@@ rup@@ ting cor@@ respon@@ ses .
the first example requires a lot of you , and some of you probably don &apos;t have to have a lot at all at all .
in the present moment , we have a very modern example that goes over and over again .
you have to , of course , to the battery , you can also communicate to the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
i mean , all of a sudden that it &apos;s un@@ important to the success , the us@@ ability will become an app@@ lic@@ ation .
i met m@@ r a@@ dies in 2008 two years ago , in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney shares par@@ enting .
&quot; i know , boy , the al@@ ga@@ e , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , that &apos;s un@@ belie@@ vable .
in the moment , it was as if a film is dem@@ and@@ ing a libr@@ ist .
now , i don &apos;t love that question , because she has the analy@@ tics of our food system for the last 50 years .
that was the cause . it was the legal plan of american agriculture .
this is really important because this is a reali@@ zation that doesn &apos;t exist in a single wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ a@@ ei@@ ana .
if we can do that , then this bis@@ bis@@ p a set of data , perhaps a new source of information .
the only thing that happened is , i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 kilometers away from the ocean .
and i realized how much deep@@ -@@ sea pi@@ cks , a space test .
and then we started , we went to the bis@@ mar@@ ck , and they explor@@ ed with robo@@ tic air@@ s .
but energy and climate are incredibly important for those people on the planet on the planet .
and there are sur@@ ely clear about how bad these effects are , but they &apos;ll be extremely bad .
the sun doesn &apos;t sh@@ ill all day ; it doesn &apos;t seem to be the wind every day as well as the wind too .
there are very , very few things that you can tell , which is a chance in a million .
and , although it really appe@@ ars , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because people are squ@@ ee@@ zing very quickly .
the out@@ come is , no matter where i &apos;m going to be , as though i was a sub@@ stance .
and because you &apos;re obs@@ essed , you &apos;re going to be cut from the spirit , how can you be dama@@ ged ?
you can only get rid of a couple of other chemicals that can be called the ma@@ o den@@ at@@ u@@ ri@@ er .
now , that doesn &apos;t give them a ph@@ d at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than the tri@@ be .
his un@@ cle fin@@ ed with her sac@@ ra@@ ti@@ a , the people dro@@ pped ne@@ p@@ al .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we are , and how big the images are .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time sitting here , except to say that we are also going to contribu@@ te to this area .
we made small pieces , and we made a mis@@ er@@ ror cor@@ rec@@ tion , and we had a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters .
recently , i spoke to the eastern industry , and they said that they were doing this model right .
i &apos;m absolutely certain life in space , and it can move to a@@ qua@@ tic conditions .
clearly , with a virus , it &apos;s very simple that it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria to deal with bacteria .
so people who think of evolution as a gene that &apos;s changed at the time is a lot of biology .
the electr@@ on@@ ance industry had a do@@ zen components , and look at the diversity of it .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like . we know exactly how their genetic code is going to look .
and we think we &apos;ll be the first one with the su@@ l@@ ens of the fourth generation , and in about 18 months .
he lives in the deep sea , about a half and a half miles deep , water@@ -@@ temperature temper@@ atures .
now , a language is not just the sum of the vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ at@@ or or a series of gra@@ ms .
so if you want to have better , you &apos;ve got to beat up here and hold your fra@@ ction of the process .
the next slide i &apos;m talking about is a time lap@@ se of what happened over the last 25 years .
if you want to know , as you know the sea rise through agriculture circu@@ it , they go into the ocean .
there &apos;s an old african sp@@ ell : &quot; if you want to be quick , walk yourself .
here i am -- this is a fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i series that i found out in a simple equ@@ ation program .
there are things like this that are completely transforma@@ tive plants on the wat@@ ers .
and it &apos;s about a play@@ ful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
so that you have a citi@@ zen to be able to deal with these scientific technologies .
and so it &apos;s so sick in us that we can hand@@ le virtu@@ ally cor@@ related with virtu@@ ty .
what &apos;s happened is the machine age and is happening is the book , and it &apos;s the photo@@ li@@ fel@@ ong .
but these concep@@ ts of cyber@@ age , which brings us to re@@ disco@@ vers these possibilities again .
maybe you can stand up for a second so that you can talk to the two about the project about the project .
ah , what you can see is , here &apos;s another explan@@ ation from what you see .
if profess@@ ors are going to be a lot like profess@@ ors , they &apos;re going to be in a lot like this , a lot of research se@@ me@@ ster .
back to my own subject of general interface , and the theme of what , of course , is da@@ ying .
so , in large and whole , we are very hop@@ e@@ ful that we actually have what the goal is .
at home in new york , i &apos;m head@@ ed from the development department of a non@@ profit , ro@@ bin hood .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep it meaning@@ ful .
i have spent a lot of time trying to be there , myself , myself , myself , and at the same time .
the next day , everybody went to the center of the city , and the prime minister at the same time .
so in this project , we designed a couple of small mark@@ ers to pur@@ sue the g@@ arb@@ age during the system .
so the idea is , actually , we are embra@@ cing people with them , colle@@ c@@ tively .
through my work , i try to ex@@ pose that people are not separ@@ ated by nature , and that everything connected .
ice ber@@ ry is born as a li@@ p of a g@@ le@@ ck or cut out of ice she@@ ets .
then one day , he came back and said , &quot; pa@@ ps , my legs cr@@ b@@ b@@ bi@@ bles . &quot;
because it &apos;s a far@@ ce that somebody else is wearing this , not communic@@ ating . &quot;
well , one epi@@ ph@@ any is usually something that you might find because you dro@@ pped it somewhere else .
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 parts , as you know from docum@@ entation .
and it seemed like a little bit of pre@@ p@@ y bo@@ x , this real re@@ al-@@ time system .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital war@@ head with the ro@@ tor@@ ta@@ controll@@ er .
the ro@@ tor is this moving part within the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , these black object that you see .
but not only that , and they connect them to connect with the universe and others out there .
some of you may have heard of me a few weeks ago , a few weeks ago , on e@@ bay .
it turns out , &quot; we want to have nothing to do with your film . &quot;
but look , the problem was that my idea had an at@@ ti@@ al er@@ ror , and that was the following .
and every time i intervie@@ wer someone , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
i have to talk to the man on the street who are like me , ot@@ to users .
now , as a film film festi@@ val , we could see that .
those of you who are really interested in art can click on here -- but i &apos;ll click that now .
this is one of the pictures that we &apos;ve determin@@ ed with something called the gre@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x technology .
i &apos;m going to zo@@ om into one of my favorite str@@ ange@@ s , until i &apos;m really on the tree .
each of them , each -- equal or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and make your own museum -- from all those images , you can put your own colle@@ ction .
and so they took all of these obser@@ va@@ tions , and they called them the theory of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
so , imagine what you would be able to do at the same time , how would that feel like that ?
in the fall of the fall , a friend of gu@@ atem@@ ala oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o shares the link to ted@@ talk .
i have tried to make sure that they are valuable cities to be much more valuable they are than they are .
but dan@@ ny , in the entire american pur@@ suit , it &apos;s about life , freedom , pur@@ suit of happiness .
so , the performance is to work with prototyp@@ es , much more -- but let &apos;s see how shif@@ ting teams .
if you have 10 teams , you get about 6 , you get about 6 , the stable structures .
if anybody could have created a five-@@ in@@ ch , he would have car@@ ried the price home .
the challenge provi@@ des a common experience , a common language , the right prototyp@@ e , to build the right prototyp@@ e .
and you can go into the past ; you can &apos;t go in the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
they &apos;ve been re@@ formed the demo@@ graphi@@ cs of the planet in a way that no war has ever been able to do .
about a decade ago , i wrote a paper on vac@@ cin@@ ation for &quot; the new york &quot; -- a little artic@@ les .
e@@ ung ac@@ e@@ teri@@ a , a little anti-@@ o@@ xic@@ a , which helps them go on the jum@@ ps .
you know , in the next 50 years , we need to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment , 70 percent .
we can move them , where we want them to move them , and we will move them where we want to go .
i know we can , and as far as i &apos;ve been around , is something that the world needs now .
in fact , there &apos;s so much about its place that i can sha@@ ke it without the kni@@ fe fall down .
it &apos;s how content or pleas@@ ed is , if this person is thinking about her life .
and the main lesson we do , i think , is that they are really different .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , they don &apos;t get the cor@@ rect answer .
they lie , they turn them , they &apos;re conf@@ used , and they really produce dr@@ ought .
three billion hours a week is not approach@@ ing enough problems in the world .
but not only does a mission , but a mission that f@@ its to your current level in play , right ?
also , this epi@@ c history , this in@@ spir@@ ing story , why we are there and what we have to do .
his work is geni@@ us . he exam@@ ined why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worl@@ ds .
so he says , actually , he can make sense , because they can do more online worl@@ ds than in the real life .
we have this ban@@ ner in our office in pal@@ o al@@ to , it squ@@ ee@@ ze the future .
and the last game , we put out on mar@@ ch 3@@ rd , and it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank bank .
in particular , the last two words were very up@@ set , &quot; very healthy &quot; and healthy .
our language is re@@ duc@@ ing the social change in many cases through a technologi@@ cal change .
wi@@ dri@@ ties are not ob@@ stac@@ le that we have to take care of our lives better .
and we don &apos;t pre@@ tend our kids to feel like they can &apos;t ada@@ pt .
maybe that &apos;s exactly the point of wi@@ dri@@ ties , a perception of the universe , a sense of our own force .
and i hear like a guy behind me says , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not an army mul@@ lin . &quot;
if you have a spirit about those quali@@ ties , we can create a new reality and new existence form .
and you &apos;re going to tell you all the nutri@@ ents that you could just want to offer on your heart .
they live in a world that has information and communic@@ ations in the ab@@ und@@ ance as anybody could ever have predi@@ cted predi@@ ction .
so the neurons are the information force that made these cell communities .
a method which is particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve been working on a lot of time is evolution itself .
when we wanted to travel in a car , we jum@@ ped into a car and s@@ hr@@ in@@ ked over the sky .
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is in@@ dis@@ crimin@@ ate , but it &apos;s also very time .
now , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yeah , grand@@ ma . i &apos;m talking . &quot;
i said , &quot; no , no , no . all right . i don &apos;t want a be@@ er . &quot;
and today , in al@@ ab@@ ama , 3@@ 4 percent of the male black people would be lost their vote right .
even after geno@@ cide in r@@ wand@@ a , there was this will@@ ing@@ ness , but not in this country .
so imagine that these artificial intelligence provi@@ des a mobile phones of a mobile phone to do that .
we are , as far as we can , for pleas@@ ures , to write ourselves in this code .
so , what are three billion growing , mental , product , product members of the human community are killing us ?
and it showed that the human pattern recogni@@ zes the pattern better than the best super@@ computer .
never make a mistake , but no one &apos;s thinking about the details of how this is supposed to be done .
i re@@ gre@@ t . but i &apos;m going to try to learn how to make it happen to ad@@ mission other people .
as you see , the cam@@ ms were by pal@@ ms and a couple of man@@ gro@@ ves .
they found an article with a lot of fol@@ ded thought , they could dete@@ ct the cre@@ ators of this mind .
for example , this is mr. di@@ mit@@ ry gol@@ ar@@ bo@@ v from ja@@ w in u@@ kra@@ ine .
for that non-@@ engineer , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its was just another material , electr@@ on@@ ics just became another material .
please help us do that , and try to make the health just a little bit better , but take your hand .
the more possibilities they were available , the way they put their entire money into reti@@ re@@ ment market houses .
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
today , we want to talk about how video vi@@ ral , and then finally , why that &apos;s important at all .
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ a sen@@ ended the t@@ we@@ et that made the video last so popular .
and i was com@@ posed by a piece of puzz@@ le to the next categ@@ ory , and the g@@ ones didn &apos;t occu@@ r .
but in fact , my interest began at photogra@@ photograph@@ y when i received my first digital camera , at age 15 .
and when you take a picture with a camera , the process , if you squ@@ ee@@ ze it , you squ@@ ee@@ ze it .
so i wanted to create something else , something that begins when it &apos;s measu@@ red .
so , i would say , there are three simple laws to follow a reali@@ stic out@@ come .
from the people who were standing over the age of 24 , only three percent actually bought a glass of mar@@ ker .
we had a team last year in boston lo@@ ws in boston , the code for america &apos;s code .
we had a team that worked last year at a project in boston , for three people , three and a half months .
we are here on this line , in a cros@@ sing world from the bis@@ her@@ s world to a new kind of world .
so the question i &apos;d like to ask myself , and i often care about myself , is like this new world ?
to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things about technology , which is really nothing to do with technology or computers .
and each time it divi@@ ded , the regul@@ ated chemicals occu@@ r to un@@ equal chemicals .
so this ten@@ ds to survive longer , and they spread into bigger ex@@ tend .
in fact , reci@@ pe for us , our genes , from the ex@@ act same scri@@ p@@ ts and the same writing .
and the beautiful thing is , i &apos;ve been in the last two years now that the scientists have been able to put themselves on my side .
can i do that directly , or i need an n , or do i need an o@@ un@@ ce for it .
in the last 20 years alone , 15 thousand tons of ur@@ ani@@ ans have been spread on our fields in germany .
that &apos;s why all western rich people are always exp@@ and@@ ing the infrastructure , and then they are im@@ per@@ a@@ ged .
they could just throw a li@@ ter into a li@@ ter al@@ mor@@ l , and then the device would be ru@@ ined over years .
the du@@ tch government was expla@@ ined to be the first country in the world , which is phosp@@ hor@@ us w@@ inning phosp@@ hor@@ us .
that &apos;s not exactly right , because we don &apos;t know how much away we don &apos;t know how much away it is .
but if you are in it@@ al@@ y , every foot@@ print , the water is going to grow longer in the wi@@ dow .
so not to save , we avoid , avoid , re@@ duc@@ ing , not a school management , it &apos;s smart waste .
they think that the components of the notes have just written everything in the notes , which he was looking at .
and i was a lot too young , so that he was very up@@ set , when i finally started studying .
our organis@@ m has created a great way of creating such in@@ conven@@ tional emotions like nei@@ ther just to get rid of them .
that human beings from the ap@@ e were coming , and , yes , it would be a common ance@@ st@@ or between people and ap@@ es .
now , here is another philosop@@ hi@@ cal subject , a perman@@ ent bu@@ g out of the philosoph@@ y .
that means that , in the moment , they have to make sure that rene@@ w@@ ables can take the whole net .
isn &apos;t it going to be , you know , car play cra@@ st@@ le , we don &apos;t know anything , calcul@@ ating it .
if i saw that that there &apos;s a d@@ al@@ mati@@ an in there , you know that .
he talked about invisible er@@ ror , and he was talking about him in the bat@@ tles .
and as i was playing , i realized that in na@@ th@@ ani@@ ze &apos;s eyes , there was a complete shift .
na@@ th@@ ani@@ ze trans@@ formed in understanding in a quie@@ t curious and an@@ gu@@ t .
even better , he was re@@ lie@@ ved in a@@ qu@@ ak@@ a after the most common standards of sustain@@ ability .
it &apos;s a incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part , &quot; a cro@@ co@@ di@@ le to the kitchen . &quot;
and my head became very we@@ ak about that piece of sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce that i had on the ev@@ ening .
you know , i &apos;m right , because if the future is good food , it will be deli@@ cious .
and in fact , because in the middle section here , people are the most active and they are over here on the most pre@@ domin@@ ating .
now when i look around here , i see the ath@@ le@@ tes that appear in this ex@@ ception , and the sport areas .
the ph@@ ant@@ as@@ y of nature doesn &apos;t know any fron@@ ti@@ se , as op@@ posed to our own , human imagination .
until today , i feel deep@@ est a@@ we for what i see on my tra@@ cks .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s the same as i am in a science fi@@ p film .
our inten@@ tion was to take place and look at the inside of the ship , which had never been done before .
it felt like i felt physi@@ cally within the ship re@@ tail of the animal re@@ tail .
we looked at docum@@ entation recor@@ ds , but actually , science is science science .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational human@@ ism and people began to believe that creativity completely came from their own individual .
and then the vo@@ o@@ do@@ ids love to say , &quot; your white wal@@ ks in the church and talk about god .
so , in@@ fan@@ ts are nei@@ ther sen@@ ti@@ ment@@ or , they &apos;re not going to be cut from the no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a .
so , this is all fli@@ ck@@ r pictures , and they all bel@@ ong to each other that &apos;s related to each other .
and that &apos;s really exciting , when you think of the th@@ res@@ sec@@ tic information of the se@@ man@@ tic information , a lot of these pictures .
and you should not have seen this yet in your own business , you can be sure they &apos;ll soon be going to be .
i &apos;m going to give you one more dra@@ matic example of invest@@ ments in volun@@ t@@ ary ages .
and these other things like many attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures , and it &apos;s going to be what they &apos;re going to do with less attra@@ cting .
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all got -- the secret to happiness is low expec@@ tations .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these te@@ ens , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help them .
that &apos;s how we think that this is a situation in the software that can actually build its own hard@@ ware in a biological system .
the chromo@@ some that was in the cell has no control ; the chromo@@ som@@ es we &apos;ve ever put .
now , i argu@@ ed that this is not the geni@@ us -- it &apos;s based on 3@@ .@@ 5 billion years of evolution .
within a short time period , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
so here &apos;s a spec@@ tac@@ ular picture of the at@@ las in the engineering of it that you see the scale .
but in the old gre@@ e@@ ks and ro@@ me , people didn &apos;t believe creativity comes from people , okay ?
they &apos;re not taught them anymore . that means , if nothing was done , they &apos;re already dead .
and it &apos;s full of he@@ di@@ al , and it makes all of those ob@@ tain@@ able expec@@ tations to success .
even i had work , or ideas that went through a source of me , which i really couldn &apos;t identify .
if you really want to exist , come back to a cheap moment , if i can take care of you .
because you see that i have anything i have , i don &apos;t have more than that .
but that doesn &apos;t push very enough to tell the serious power of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the sli@@ des of the ir@@ on .
here are the ones that have been stri@@ pped in the last few years , with a couple of green alterna@@ tives that were pro@@ posed .
an interesting circum@@ stance at that kind of appli@@ cations is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of in@@ struc@@ tions .
i &apos;ve got to get a little out of that , and i &apos;m looking at bio@@ ha@@ cking with modern molecular biology .
and then we have do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ sensitive or@@ g or@@ g or@@ g , d.@@ i@@ .@@ bi@@ .@@ bi@@ o .
and then the vis@@ it@@ ors could go into the room , put on this chair , put this hel@@ met down .
and then you can get a lot of the particles out there , and then go too close to the wei@@ gh@@ ty .
now we think our love to stories depen@@ ds upon us as children on the la@@ p of our parents .
you might know that if you &apos;re a little bit interested in the austr@@ ali@@ an ur@@ an population .
i &apos;ve been just asked if this s@@ ack is a talking s@@ ack , and i &apos;m going to talk to myself .
nam@@ ely , they have pro@@ s@@ ie@@ kes , they think they &apos;re seeing something that they can see , un@@ pre@@ ce@@ dly .
here &apos;s a ger@@ man car maker that gives you the opportunity to con@@ tex@@ ts your car completely .
part of the ice that i &apos;m at is very young -- a couple thousand years old .
you can see here , he begins roll@@ ing , and the boat has moved to the other side , man stands there .
it needs the same -- he needs , he would need love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to us , to give these things .
while i was thinking about it , a word that says , &quot; i collect a bad wh@@ one . &quot;
about a month later , i went to visit my daughter -- first of all arti@@ facts , not much arti@@ stic talent ...
the most important po@@ sts there for the development of nuclear wea@@ pon is the ur@@ an in@@ cen@@ tive facili@@ ty in nat@@ ung .
but in the new project i work , my new film , we investi@@ gate the world of marketing that adverti@@ ses .
but usually , i usually have an in@@ cen@@ tor , like sun@@ glas@@ ses , or a je@@ wel@@ ry and a je@@ wel@@ ry .
they have companies like ne@@ nest , fe@@ ep@@ y , sar@@ mark helped discover that brand person@@ ality .
are they et@@ ched , traditional care , prote@@ cting , em@@ pa@@ thetic , em@@ pa@@ thetic .
in the entire city , there &apos;s been no time for five years , no poster , no fl@@ yer , nothing .
i mean , i hope that we are going to talk to this digital medium of art , and they represent them very carefully .
if we had a scale to measure the ap@@ ti@@ te of he@@ mis@@ pher@@ es , we could see her brain .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t have a single city that will wel@@ come them .
they &apos;re deci@@ ding for things that they make less content , even if they make it more obje@@ ctive better .
the first time i had 10 years ago in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , where i saw my first ice ber@@ ry .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re choo@@ sing the choices .
because ta@@ ste@@ ka k@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ a k@@ im@@ a k@@ im@@ a k@@ im@@ a will give us new and interesting things , and show them a big audience .
who would have said &quot; double rain@@ bo@@ w black or &quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at &apos;s predi@@ ction ?
in a pris@@ on@@ able case , my sister and i , then she himself , and my grandmother , drin@@ king himself and my grandmother .
she opened up a computer business , and then she took a co@@ sm@@ me@@ tic training and opened a deal .
in one part i was the classi@@ c asi@@ an student , the ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence to self-@@ repli@@ cation .
she remin@@ ded me that i was as old as she was at the same time when we had the boat .
and although i gradu@@ ated , i realized that i could find myself a career in j@@ ur@@ a .
most of our ideas were mad , but they were a few brilliant things , and we managed to get through .
a few days later , we went to a budd@@ h@@ ist temp@@ le , and they sat around with their sar@@ g .
she asked the mon@@ ks , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her is that cold ? &quot;
but if we collect photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about because otherwise you &apos;ll just see them wrong .
the program is called the code for america , and it &apos;s a little bit like the pe@@ tro@@ scop@@ e for computer ge@@ e@@ ks .
they are very fru@@ strated with her , but they don &apos;t com@@ pla@@ in , they fix them .
and sure enough , we could have rele@@ ased these hy@@ dr@@ ants all the time , and many people do .
find out how you were going to survive -- most of our players have lost in the game .
the idea was really tan@@ gi@@ ble to you , you know , there are people who live with mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os .
so , i decided that the light bul@@ let &apos;s going to be a contribu@@ tion to the community of this year-old that this year would be contribu@@ tion to this .
let us first look at the fossi@@ ls fossil fu@@ els , either coal or natural gas .
the al gore book &quot; we &apos;ve got the choice &quot; and david m@@ ck@@ a@@ gens &quot; shares the power of hot air . &quot;
we need market expec@@ tan@@ ts , carbon , ca@@ p &amp; amp ; trade is a price of price .
then they spend a bit of time in planning and organization , sk@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i , and put sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i .
and that team that is regul@@ ated and the work is going to be impro@@ ved , makes the performance improve .
and we &apos;ve never been able to put it sensi@@ ble , just like we can today .
he &apos;s got calls at home because people like to tell him where their children go to school .
what that &apos;s really telling us is that we could think about ourselves and about other people , in the sense of two species of self .
maybe a lot of time , if you think of how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
and maybe some of you may have some of the new book of mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well , &quot; cros@@ s-@@ section . &quot;
the second largest wi@@ ki of the world , with almost 8@@ 0,000 employees , is the world of war@@ craft wi@@ ki .
and the only thing is , you think you can change the virtual worl@@ ds , but not the real real world .
we want to introdu@@ ce ourselves to the best out@@ come , and then people explain this idea in reality .
these are very good things and ar@@ mu@@ ts@@ ty , which means almost everyone on the planet on planet planets .
they found 500 creative solutions that they could read when they &apos;re &quot; super@@ stru@@ en . &quot;
this is just an example of many , as adults can move into practice posi@@ tions , the imagination of a kid &apos;s imagination .
they don &apos;t have these people , and they looked at them , they were extraordinary and valuable .
his flexi@@ ble design can allow it deep to sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce , and we need to ex@@ tend to ex@@ tend war@@ ning mov@@ ements .
we are as far as we imagine with our industri@@ alized part@@ ners that year this year .
they live in the dep@@ ths of the physical world , and they are hard to do it .
i think just like you sometimes play alone , and we s@@ hr@@ ink boundar@@ ies of our inner worl@@ ds .
so , for example , i worked with people who are si@@ lu@@ ese tw@@ ins , two people in a body .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually think of this person , but that &apos;s not really what you are .
the brilliant world world had not had concep@@ ts based on the dna , but they had concep@@ ts of birth right now .
i get all my clo@@ th@@ es from the two hand , and in pla@@ d-@@ hand@@ -@@ hand@@ -@@ hand@@ -@@ sh@@ ops .
then we have the little chip chip , and we started tracking it , and i started tracking it .
and the first project is something that we &apos;ve done a few years ago in ad@@ oles@@ go@@ za , spa@@ in .
there are no do@@ ors or windows , but if you &apos;re approach@@ ing it , it will open up and leave it .
it could have every single point of ima@@ gery that comes from people , from the mov@@ ements of people , from the mov@@ ements of people like this .
these mental ori@@ entation is the essen@@ ce of what i believe are the ted communities that have to be enga@@ ged in it .
mean@@ while , in the same year at the same year , the following revolution announ@@ ced the next revolution , the next building block .
so west governments eat tot@@ al@@ it@@ an@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ an@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ arian governments with their own citizens .
how does it stop with the arab spring and the things that have happened in eg@@ y@@ pt ?
and because you can explain this idea in one minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories to use time .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t do the same er@@ ror that i was looking forward . &quot;
although al@@ umin@@ ini@@ um shares 8@@ .@@ 3 percent of the world &apos;s earth@@ mass , it &apos;s not as p@@ ure metal .
na@@ po@@ le@@ ons got a sil@@ ver bri@@ ck , na@@ po@@ le@@ on himself had gol@@ d-@@ bri@@ ck .
i &apos;ve been looking through the new@@ spa@@ pers , and after the best head@@ lines i could find .
i think we need to do more to help people the sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce of crimin@@ al , not less .
they &apos;ve seen in this audience , the community , to help them , and to help them do something .
if i was a real e@@ ye@@ wit@@ n , i would have written her on a virus , rele@@ ased them in the room .
we would never let someone fly with a plane for nine air@@ planes , the dro@@ w@@ ning , a cr@@ y@@ pt .
the united states of america is sent@@ enced to death in the world .
in so@@ cially , and black parts of the population are des@@ per@@ ation and hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , because of these changes .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people to say things that they don &apos;t believe in first .
the poor apple were tra@@ pped in in@@ dr@@ as , in an old mu@@ ff@@ ly book .
another idea that &apos;s fascin@@ ated as a child is that there &apos;s a whole galaxy in a single mar@@ ble .
now , the lunch is before and i think i &apos;m going to hear up here now before i get cho@@ ked .
now , i say , &quot; computers , take 10 percent of the consequences , which i showed you the next 10 percent of the consequences .
let &apos;s say , i want to make numbers that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve already used .
it turns out that mi@@ ben@@ el has spent the biggest part of his career in the mi@@ k@@ um@@ i national park in africa .
nam@@ ely , to make music on the instrument , their own music and feel even before .
because i don &apos;t think it says , i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s my taste , because i can &apos;t co@@ ok .
then this un@@ comfortable feeling , it might not look like you , and it &apos;ll always be more like this .
but we should just make us know that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a beautiful somewhere else else .
and then they ran her to her husband and said , &quot; that &apos;s probably not true of charles . &quot;
and if you place the ex@@ act between two equ@@ als in the middle between two equ@@ als , then he saved .
i &apos;m also telling the politicians , if you &apos;re in ber@@ lin@@ -@@ ad@@ oles@@ cent ad@@ oles@@ cent control of our device .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the energy hunger of the world , which is oc@@ curr@@ ed with this el , because you don &apos;t need appro@@ val .
this el is going to be a little ris@@ ky , and the wind , sun car@@ ries the load that they can generate the bigger fra@@ ction .
but if you want to do a lot of these inter@@ actions , you want to put a net together , so that &apos;s going to be very complicated .
so , if you &apos;re in se@@ vent@@ h percent rene@@ w@@ ables , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
because the music allows it to re@@ form the mind and in@@ san@@ e with help and creativity in something real real .
they built this complicated sequence of can@@ als , and they put out water out of the land , and they put out them in the flow .
and here , here he is a pattern of trees that remem@@ bers him to the tanz@@ ani@@ an gi@@ ra@@ ffe .
and i &apos;m interested in looking at the notes , even when i mean , they can turn out to the notes .
they bre@@ ed in a city 2@@ 40 miles away , where the miner@@ al force is better for nest he@@ art@@ -up .
what we need now is a radi@@ cally new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food of food actually taste good .
so you see that information and data in this way is very much remin@@ ded of a living information model .
now , what we &apos;ve been here is called the ti@@ tle pi@@ le of every single sing@@ le-@@ print , which has ever been prin@@ ted .
in math class , i was always caught from teacher , as i am teaching text@@ book text@@ book , sle@@ eping .
i took a pool in a pool of y@@ yel@@ ca in the middle of the winter in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york .
in &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss &quot; i was able to connect my love for the under@@ water world and di@@ ve with the film .
from these two experiences , a whole new world of creativity is a new world of film to film .
but i &apos;ve come to believe that by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to show it to the re@@ ck . we fil@@ h the real w@@ re@@ ck .
to me , young film@@ makers say , &quot; give me a little bit of how i could do that . &quot;
in fact , you burn the tr@@ ash , and you can even use the waste of re@@ ac@@ tors .
we need to lead dialo@@ gue to practical and complete , and also the things that are taught by government .
and , you know , ter@@ ra@@ power , if everything is good , and that &apos;s a big wish , could it be easy .
what happens when you put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , you don &apos;t have time more and what happened ?
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time when there were cars or twitter or &quot; america se@@ wer@@ ing the super@@ star . &quot;
it was ill@@ umin@@ ated by the inside , and from the bottom , and everything ill@@ umin@@ ated through a di@@ vin@@ ly fire .
and the same , like the bio@@ sphere was a lot , it happened with the eth@@ ni@@ c -- only with the greater speed .
if we ask the world &apos;s teeth in the world of human beings , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
anywhere where we look , things and little things , material things , lifest@@ yle , is a question of choice .
do you want cut down , so , bla@@ h bla@@ h bla@@ h bla@@ h bla@@ h bla@@ h bla@@ h , &quot; and so on .
i had very low expec@@ tations , and i had no con@@ cre@@ te expec@@ tations when it only gave them a type .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i believe that many bi@@ ologists have tried to understand and that on different levels .
now , let &apos;s try to ask if we can live re@@ form , or could we make new life , from this digital universe ?
design is key , and if you want to start digital information in the computer , that digital information really has to be er@@ ror .
when we were sequen@@ ced the genome for the first time in 199@@ 5 , the mis@@ er@@ ase costs a bit 10,000 bas@@ es per capit@@ a .
today , three people are living on this planet for every year in 194@@ 6 ; within 40 years , they &apos;ll be four .
this is what i &apos;m doing . it calls at@@ las meter in the wid@@ th , 22 feet in diam@@ e@@ ter .
they can do that because when you cool@@ er them very far , they become the super@@ conduc@@ tor .
when i heard that , i thought that this is un@@ common -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process process is .
he just looked up in the hea@@ v@@ ens and said , &quot; change , can you not see that i &apos;m driving a car ? hang .
so i took my look from the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt and i talked to my com@@ ment towards a blan@@ k corner of the room .
it &apos;s the ic@@ on of all of what we are , and what we are ast@@ on@@ ishing as an amazing wis@@ sth@@ ous species .
and the west ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , which appe@@ ars over a few under@@ water is@@ lands , is especially strong in mel@@ ting .
i want you to start thinking about the time of your childhood , when you were playing with blu@@ als .
then , after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s mix@@ ed up and you &apos;ve got a new letter , and new ways to explore .
and you store it by just a ton si@@ le to a sequence of sound .
and then more effective effects like temp@@ o and lau@@ t@@ star@@ ty that you &apos;re using on the whole sequence .
and that &apos;s not in the ho@@ b@@ by@@ o , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also do a lot .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is the navi@@ gation and the to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of areas of areas of areas of songs .
and this project , i &apos;ve been brought together as an example , as again at this arch@@ a@@ tional , cognitive models of adop@@ tion .
and that game conne@@ cts the virtual world , the data that we produce , with the real world .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m pro@@ se@@ cu@@ ting that i see the d@@ al ma@@ tin@@ er .
but i want to say , of course , there &apos;s a very dist@@ ant capacity to make certain things happen .
that means that all in life coun@@ ts , it &apos;s not about saving it .
this is the first e@@ col@@ o@@ gical back@@ pack , actually , to go back to the cycle .
it &apos;s also , if i &apos;m on a du@@ o partner on stage , and we have the same wa@@ vel@@ ength .
mean@@ while , i &apos;ve been working as a ch@@ op@@ in with two-@@ year year when he wrote that piece .
i think , in clo@@ sing , to me , the main thing is that all the wonderful things don &apos;t come here from google .
if you think they &apos;re inside and out there &apos;s a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t have .
and as a computer , you start re@@ acting in other ways , and you &apos;ll be able to re@@ act , you &apos;ll be driven .
a different example of the senses here is not about people , but about things that we use and consu@@ me .
this is a map that shows you all the chi@@ ps , which invol@@ ves a ma@@ c computer , how they came together .
all the kids from ar@@ a@@ go@@ za came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
you can have some kind of flexi@@ ble screen or ad , like that -- a regular forma@@ tion in two dimensions .
during the ice mountain , he puts miner@@ al drin@@ king drin@@ king water , which is a lot of a life chan@@ ger .
so i looked at her immediately , and they said , &quot; no problem , we probably got a few birds . &quot;
it could say , for example , an us@@ ern@@ ist power station , or a chemical plant in germany .
basically , it goes out onto the bu@@ squ@@ e nuclear power station , in nat@@ ung .
the big digital thre@@ w -- we got a gli@@ mp@@ se by looking at ourselves very carefully and data structures .
i spent the last couple of years trying to put myself in situations that usually are very difficult and at times they are dangerous .
you know , it &apos;s funny because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ulti@@ mate respect to the audience .
and you can also see it here , individu@@ or , wi@@ i , min@@ i co@@ oper@@ er and je@@ t@@ blue .
they wanted to have nothing to do with this film because they had no control over the finished product .
so , as people are trying to make a perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
that &apos;s the left half , which is the lo@@ gic side , and then half the rights that are intui@@ tive .
that was the state of some years ago ; you needed quant@@ um mechan@@ ics to describe small , tiny particles .
there were the opportunity to live in a city that would be in ja@@ dur@@ as , rather than hundreds of kilometers away from the north .
and it poin@@ ted to the bus cam@@ ps of tou@@ ri@@ sts that came together and usually had their c@@ ameras .
it turns out that in fact invol@@ ves more information than we think , we only have to simpli@@ fy them .
half of the cli@@ ents is going to be 5@@ 6 auto@@ le-@@ colors , four gest@@ ures to the ger@@ ms , four gest@@ ures .
my mother worked on far@@ ms , and then on a flight factory , six days , dou@@ ble@@ -@@ la@@ yers .
there was a meeting for re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation and a quie@@ t voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to walk you out of my way . &quot;
and because of that aid , i was in the last year of ju@@ dge as a young austr@@ ali@@ an of the year .
we have three perfect imag@@ in@@ al objects , which we can all identify ourselves in a three-@@ dimensional world .
it &apos;s very important that these tsun@@ am@@ i@@ ans work , but people ste@@ al the bat@@ ter@@ ies .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , please , i want you to think about this , because the things are changing .
so if you are fac@@ ed with the government , you don &apos;t care about using your voices .
so let &apos;s start rely on computer , for a process which is very distin@@ cted from the classi@@ c engineering system very distin@@ se .
i was underneath the hea@@ v@@ ens in the desert , with su@@ fi@@ -@@ sing@@ ers al@@ yl@@ a al@@ i .
i mean , think about , if ant@@ on@@ o dama@@ si@@ o wonder@@ s her , you think about the bacteria ?
a com@@ mission of mine was writing a few weeks ago , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m a little too smart .
hundreds of thousands of un@@ necessary dead in a country that will be min@@ ed than any other one of these disease is being plastic .
the reason i put my wr@@ ist is that it invol@@ ves the actual secret of the illusion of illusion .
the stories of gut refle@@ ctions were different , and because a very important part of the story is how it ends .
and that &apos;s true for the stories that allow memory to us , and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we inv@@ ent .
but now , because the neighb@@ or self is responsible by the end -- some people could end up on the end of california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pur@@ sue what &apos;s happening to people in the hope , happ@@ ier .
6@@ 0,000 dollars in the year is people are un@@ happy , and they become increasingly un@@ happy , the anno@@ yed her .
d@@ k : well , you know , i think there &apos;s con@@ science for the matter of happiness in politics in politics .
so i looked at games like world of war@@ craft , which provi@@ des the ide@@ al environment to collabor@@ ative proble@@ m-@@ solving .
where you go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to finish their epi@@ c mission .
that was the first strategy of real time in real time , and that was 16 years ago .
the point of view is compu@@ tation of a super@@ computer that people only left 23 years on the planet .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s very close to see , but he &apos;s constantly on me .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve en@@ counter@@ ed ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did something i was doing , i was writing a paper , and i went on .
or , are we sel@@ ec@@ tively different at@@ tribu@@ tes that we want to have for some of us and not for others ?
not long after@@ wards , a doctor in my hospital and he said , &quot; am@@ anda , they &apos;ll never walk again . &quot;
and i want to show you that this is fu@@ k@@ u , a young female , and it plays chil@@ ls with water .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is , when children are born , the two people who are two people in a body .
but today we are in a situation where we can take people &apos;s life@@ -@@ relevant organs and plant them to people .
to gras@@ p that these categ@@ ories are really inse@@ cure than we thought about me .
i know they were ra@@ cing , i know they were sa@@ ke , but they were fab@@ ul@@ ous .
and if you look at , for example , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
we find men in the mar@@ su@@ men of the people who say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
now , wealth , i want to susta@@ in certain dis@@ rup@@ ts , autonom@@ ically , in our culture .
i don &apos;t want to say that 5@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds should have the right to get their understanding to sex or to cure .
so there are some an@@ atom@@ ic dis@@ rup@@ ts that make meaning to me , and that we think should be .
h@@ ein@@ rich can mar@@ ry a woman , but mar@@ ia can only get married in a few states today .
i don &apos;t want to give science , but at the same time , sometimes it feels like science is self-@@ suff@@ i@@ cient .
in fe@@ min@@ ism , they &apos;re about to resol@@ ve about gender , so on the fe@@ min@@ ism there is nothing ration@@ ale .
and that &apos;s what he did , and he said , as he was in the right under the right bottom , he called the oper@@ ators .
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a mov@@ ement@@ -@@ driven cont@@ ange@@ ment .
and we think we are going to be blind to every future government , a government that we might have in fif@@ ty years ?
if you &apos;re in a crimin@@ al case , you &apos;ll be able to ta@@ p up your tele@@ phone .
in the last fall of the fall , it had to be in@@ soldi@@ er because it had been ha@@ cked in the last fall .
in@@ ot@@ ot@@ ar is a full cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate facili@@ ty , and it was that .
let us look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can spli@@ t the statistics in categ@@ ories .
what about the people who are not possible is because they have no access -- the people in the middle west , for example ?
every generation looks at the ima@@ gery that you have in the beginning of your conscious life , standard and it will dis@@ count everything from it .
this story , we heard many times from the gala@@ pa@@ gos , and other places , it &apos;s not very special .
we have a cognitive er@@ ror , so we can take a perfect path@@ way for a patient with a patient in pain .
in a hospital system , the medical knowledge , every two or three years , we can &apos;t mi@@ mic .
a kid in london shows the picture of a fu@@ z@@ id and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a food . &quot;
i got ti@@ ti@@ des to re@@ hy@@ dri@@ ze him and asked my colleagues too .
and it was my as@@ sign@@ ment , as the emergen@@ ce workers se@@ arch@@ ing , the emergen@@ cy patient investi@@ g@@ ated at the emergen@@ ce patient .
i even knew the potential diagno@@ sis to classi@@ fy ren@@ dered tu@@ bu@@ do@@ sis a@@ zi@@ do@@ se .
&quot; mon@@ e@@ y@@ ball comes up and looks at statistics and to use a great baseball team .
al@@ umin@@ ini@@ um was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and plat@@ in@@ um .
it car@@ es the entire information on the se@@ g@@ gers of dan@@ ger in our environment .
that we have to com@@ bine our visi@@ ons of technology and design , with entertain@@ ment and creativity , with humanity , compassion and justice .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really work right , i started working on a halt .
i &apos;m not saying that because i believe that it &apos;s virtu@@ e . i say , &quot; because identity is meaning . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do it today , you &apos;re doing something else that we do .
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to talk to ver@@ t@@ cher@@ es that you &apos;re going to take care of them . &quot;
these are ener@@ ge@@ tic arms ; you &apos;re talking about a lot of square times more surface than a regular force station .
do you practice for , for example , if you hit a human being that you can tell you , there &apos;s no predi@@ ction .
it &apos;s just interested in making yourself more care about the need to prove that there are predic@@ ts .
i have to say , you know , i &apos;ve got you ti@@ ed it hard for me to start talking from my idea .
that &apos;s it in a little style , so you can also carry on your car a little bit smaller in your mind .
you then have to go to a sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ al memory and go to winter summer and not just ti@@ ll night .
robert ben@@ p@@ ta : i want to play a thing that i sto@@ le the c@@ lar@@ est c@@ elli@@ most .
now , he mentioned some al@@ ga@@ e and some of them , and then he said , chicken p@@ el@@ lets .
there was a long pause in the capacity and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , they fly 2@@ 40 miles to the farm , and then they fly two miles back in the ev@@ ening ?
one billion -- that &apos;s more than any -- based on kr@@ as@@ ans in the distribution , not the total production .
our cor@@ n@@ els are thre@@ at@@ en@@ at@@ ed today , not due to des@@ ires , but due to des@@ per@@ ative resources .
no one had ever explor@@ ed the intern@@ al . you had no cure for it , so we developed the technology .
to me , it was more such a simple way to do my job , the actual process that changed in the out@@ come .
but in art and in studying it , we have to fail to fail because there &apos;s no guar@@ an@@ tee of trust .
almost every way for electricity is im@@ it@@ ating co2 , except rene@@ w@@ ables and nuclear energy .
i think that the stream would have been thri@@ ll@@ ed by the fact that he would have had the sound of modern history today .
vin@@ nie k@@ ho@@ s@@ la invest in do@@ zens of companies doing great things , and i have interesting opportunities to support .
there are questions and problems with people that we thought they would be right . don &apos;t be skep@@ tic@@ ism .
there &apos;s a color@@ ful cap@@ su@@ le that is yellow on the end and the other red is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le .
it turns out that the word is happ@@ ily not useful , because we use it too many different things .
and , by the way , we &apos;re a pretty good idea from happiness of the living self over time .
in fact , i am convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase dra@@ matically further dra@@ matically .
when i leave this stage , i don &apos;t know : l-@@ 1 and a half a crazy idea , 100,000 idea .
you &apos;ve got more information about world of war@@ craft in the internet than any other subject in every other wi@@ ki of the world .
so , he says it &apos;s completely logi@@ cal that players spend more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
and ge@@ ologists found evidence of global re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation , which is almost 20 years , which could explain fam@@ ine .
i &apos;d like to share with you a little bit of what i thought about a bunch of months ago about the itali@@ an wired .
and i don &apos;t want to leave the impact in the face of a human being .
in the &apos; 6@@ 0s , there was a case in the u.@@ k , and then a random study was trans@@ formed in total schools .
but only those who were still in school -- except by the students that had caught school .
but if you accept biological evolution , it &apos;s just about the past , or is it about the future ?
it &apos;s a plan to bring america back to work , make us sec@@ ure and help continue to stop global warming .
not change and technology thre@@ aten the integri@@ ty of the world &apos;s eth@@ no@@ sphere . it &apos;s power . ug@@ ly face &apos;s face .
the suffering can be un@@ sustainable , but the er@@ ror spirit of the human beings is something un@@ reli@@ able .
now you have to know that the in@@ u@@ it doesn &apos;t have fear of the cold , they used them to their advantage .
the sli@@ ps of their bad ones were made out of fish , which was made in carto@@ on skin .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , more generally they have .
we can put 6@@ ,000 million different stere@@ o out of the components that are off@@ ered a deal .
they &apos;re off@@ ering 50 invest@@ ment@@ ors of china -- 10 percent less employees than if they were only paying about five . why ?
we found out about taking 30 er@@ ror , if we would have used the original sequence , it wouldn &apos;t be able to drive up .
we need more than five billion tons of coal , 3@@ 0-@@ plus , 3@@ 0-@@ dollar color@@ ed oil . that &apos;s hundreds of millions of fe@@ t@@ ers per day .
we &apos;ve got technologies today based on these fast syn@@ thes@@ i@@ cations to do what we call combin@@ atory gene@@ tics .
the nor@@ man ma@@ an said shor@@ tly in his last interview in his last interview in his last interview : : any of my text@@ books have come to me a little bit . mind .
the ro@@ wers had the same idea , and they called this kind of body lo@@ be of creativity in mind .
she got the po@@ em on his preg@@ nan@@ cy , and she pulled it back into her body , and she took it on the paper of paper .
and how do we engage in the relationship with no understanding of our understanding , but also to main@@ tain human health ?
when i heard that story , it also has a little bit of the way i worked and it res@@ cu@@ ed me .
in a pool of blood , these people were the only ones that were never consi@@ stent by the spa@@ ins .
and you can put those sound into the sequence that you can organi@@ ze in random pattern .
there are cra@@ ig vent@@ er in the u.@@ s@@ .@@ a , who tried to make bio@@ fu@@ el , al@@ ga@@ e .
so each person who &apos;s been making a sou@@ p that he left too long is already done .
another project that made out of paris , that &apos;s been oc@@ curr@@ ed , that &apos;s pretty cool .
i &apos;m going to show you a little bit about , and i &apos;ll prove you to prove that you also have a natural ra@@ ti@@ o to virtu@@ ality .
we &apos;re not asking the story anymore in pictures anymore , but we &apos;re co@@ ating them in the language .
and we have re@@ lie@@ ved the lin@@ ity as law , and there are only ex@@ cep@@ tions , like the non-@@ lin@@ normal@@ ity .
you work at work as well as the subject of the students , with the subject of perception and per@@ cep@@ tual science .
but that &apos;s a mostly important compon@@ ent , if you want to make things very intui@@ tive .
so , they had to grow up the city , because the farmers were going to grow up in the city , and they needed to keep their products away .
and the great thing about this is that the re@@ ference rate goes back to nin@@ ari@@ as about nin@@ th percent .
you think of yourself in this time by looking at con@@ temporary images , for example , or liter@@ ature li@@ ad .
i &apos;m playing the tun@@ e for every few years , and i moved it to me , although not a single grade changed .
it &apos;s a kid who didn &apos;t learn the sing@@ ing , because the parents didn &apos;t have the parents , it &apos;s not going to be either .
sure , there are among you , who say , yes , but what do you do if i can &apos;t sing ?
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve obser@@ ved you . &quot;
i met people in their lives , so many of them did what they loved , lived on the bor@@ ders of possible .
but in a particular mode , you can create something that &apos;s still three-@@ dimensional , as though it could exist .
and yeah , i &apos;ve even sp@@ ill@@ ed the house on the island at the bottom of red to make it look swe@@ dis@@ h .
it works very simply , every time i jum@@ ped on the scale , it &apos;s my data on google health .
and chicago she &apos;s just introduced her , so the people who are pump@@ ing the bu@@ ll@@ stock open when it ra@@ ils .
it shows how the government could work better -- not like a private business , like many people think that they should think about .
now there &apos;s a large community of people who make tools that we need to connect things together .
this slide shows data from the analysis of ris@@ c process@@ ors compared to the performance of a local area networks .
either , it &apos;s going to be a classi@@ c sound cur@@ ve like this , and it &apos;s going to be something that will happen here .
so we are the pay@@ bs , and we can &apos;t quite do what the hell we &apos;re doing here is actually creating .
she became a gol@@ fer access to a world full of pir@@ ates and dis@@ connected ships and images in my mind .
when i saw the i@@ pad , i saw it as a device to per@@ su@@ ade the les@@ i@@ on all over the world .
i don &apos;t mean magic and dra@@ ps , but the magic of childhood , these ideas that we all had as children .
and that &apos;s why every book and every world will get a little mur@@ rot that i &apos;m talking about here to a magnetic device in the machine .
to be here at ted , to hear and hear how stimul@@ ating this is , i got a lot of power .
and it was my job to stay every night , until their alp@@ om@@ ons came , so i could wake them up .
finally she said , &quot; the last thing you have to talk about is &quot; you &apos;re not going to drink al@@ co@@ hol . &quot;
i &apos;m 5@@ 2 years old , and i &apos;m there i &apos;ve never had a drop al@@ co@@ hol .
my home@@ state al@@ ab@@ ama &apos;s de@@ teri@@ or@@ ated by the ele@@ ction right , if she sent@@ ences them leg@@ ge@@ ous .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m talking to my students afri@@ ro@@ american history . i talk about sla@@ very .
i &apos;m talking about terror@@ ism , and i &apos;m talking about the end of the re@@ constru@@ cted re@@ construction , until the beginning of world war ii .
if we don &apos;t deal with these hard top@@ ics , the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
but then finally , these reali@@ ties are tran@@ sc@@ as@@ sin@@ ated by suffering , ab@@ use , ab@@ use , apart .
there was a crazy line on that that there &apos;s nothing more wrong in this country that there &apos;s no behavior yet .
in fact , the media is pre@@ fer to show us negative the@@ mes because our minds are paying attention to that stage .
four years ago , ray kurz@@ shor@@ tly , and i &apos;m here at ted a new university , the sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity university .
this is why the dom@@ e of the book was made by al@@ umin@@ um .
the truth is that nobody &apos;s supposed to know what a good surge@@ on or doctor should be like .
i gave her medicine that we call di@@ u@@ re@@ graphi@@ cs , so they make the flu@@ id go@@ od@@ b@@ ye .
and the nur@@ se thought about it , and said , &quot; yeah , i think it will be going to be okay . &quot;
it &apos;s the one that says that it &apos;s not what you &apos;ve done is bad , but you &apos;re bad .
now if you were asking me a year ago , i would not be able to tell them this with gran@@ ty .
next year , when it was finished , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in dr@@ ens .
are we going to be a form of di@@ d@@ an@@ ger and im@@ form@@ ers , or rob@@ ust and poly@@ cious ?
of course , this leads to some major compli@@ cations -- in@@ ju@@ ries , 30 percent of them -- chr@@ onic in@@ ju@@ red .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it comes to a brain dis@@ connect , or about other compli@@ cations -- is the wheel@@ chair .
as you see , we have the technology , we have the plat@@ -@@ plat@@ -@@ scale , to make us happen and talk to them with them .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a bor@@ der lau@@ ghter that the trees are up@@ setting .
now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you some unique foot@@ age from the wil@@ der@@ ness .
it also goes around , as much as a lot more complicated than our ter@@ min@@ ology identi@@ fied .
and i want to think about the possibilities of how democracy could look like democracy , or looked away , if we had more enga@@ ged the mom@@ s .
i come back to my su@@ it@@ case , and tell you what i &apos;ve been talking about this exciting week here at ted .
and if it &apos;s in the contr@@ ast , if you want to reduce the inje@@ ction , you can even leave the roof down .
and here you see me when i tried to test the sensor@@ s , the water , not he@@ ating .
but then , once we have all of the scre@@ ens , you can play with color and turn it to gravity .
we looked at them , we laugh@@ ed , we cri@@ ed , and we knew they needed to be in a ho@@ spi@@ ce .
i realized then by conne@@ cting the dots that there &apos;s only a great father in life .
a second possibility is that it will be a evolution of traditional way , of course , from the forces of nature .
look , if you &apos;re in google search on google search , this is one of the first images that appe@@ ars .
woman # 2 : par@@ s hi@@ pp@@ ie , part of the yo@@ g@@ i , part of broo@@ kl@@ y@@ n-@@ girls -- i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m going to work with him and do something completely different , something that people think is going to be thinking about global image .
a lot of fun negoti@@ ators and stories , i can tell you , i can tell you about 17 , very interesting muse@@ ums .
and as i worked for google , i tried to make the je@@ je@@ ction -- art -- to bring together with technology .
so we go out , and look at how it re@@ acting , and then we start working on our intuition .
i was asked to get te@@ gu@@ ci@@ g@@ pa , and i &apos;m talking about the fourth and a half janu@@ ary .
around the world , there are 700 million people who want them to live more perman@@ ently on another place .
you know how many choices do you meet in the nine minutes of cat@@ or@@ ie ?
today , i want to talk about one of the largest decisi@@ on-@@ making problems of our modern time that decisi@@ on-@@ making problems .
it &apos;s more human beings , if it were 24 percent , as if there were six percent , about 40 percent .
the ones who really want to make a choice is 20 f@@ on@@ ds , not 300 or more f@@ on@@ ds .
the other half of the cli@@ ents have come from the opportunity , four gest@@ ures , a lot of opportunities .
it &apos;s only going to be a tiny percentage of vi@@ br@@ ine and thousands of thousands of times , and so on for the cultural moment .
after a four@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds and film meetings , a boat rus@@ hed up the la@@ ke , when fis@@ her@@ ed boat was lab@@ el@@ ed .
two days later , i came to my next not@@ e@@ al service , and i asked myself to talk to her a conversation in her office .
the cause is trans@@ formed -- in this case , a hard cause or a soft coral is mat@@ ched up .
there are many multi-@@ milli@@ main points of millions of millions of millions of electr@@ on@@ aries that you &apos;ve made your money through attac@@ king .
so , everything you have to do is connect a blue and a green , and you can build a lot bigger circu@@ it .
what we &apos;ve done here is , we &apos;ve taken every single wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ a@@ ei@@ a@@ ei@@ te , and it redu@@ ces them in a little re@@ duc@@ ement .
it &apos;s not about making the exi@@ sting one slightly less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
so , if i put them on the dinner and say , that &apos;s fre@@ ak@@ ed by cro@@ ps , then you can &apos;t help them .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we haven &apos;t been pro@@ posed to , and what you can &apos;t do is make it possible .
while you get over time , and you want a little bit more fla@@ vor@@ s , or you &apos;ve got a taste of dis@@ plac@@ ement differences .
the artist tells them something about , and especially this lady , what you don &apos;t see when you just look at the mirror .
here , they have this mechan@@ ism that we can use the gap as a great invention of our lives .
we need this location to susta@@ in that gap that hol@@ ds us up without life that we can &apos;t live .
we don &apos;t just have art in the art of the people in the world , but in the science of science , they are great gap .
now , we can build the second sentence , and say , &quot; if wol@@ f sing@@ ers were right , he &apos;s got no rand@@ om@@ ly free . &quot;
and that &apos;s where people always come and look at our experiment@@ al de@@ pos@@ iting our subje@@ cts .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i only met from my colleagues in the phil@@ harmon@@ y of los angeles .
and then it goes up and down in more common birds and al@@ ga@@ e plants plants .
and yet , when i tried in southern spa@@ in , she didn &apos;t look at fish mem@@ me at all .
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your fish . a farm that meas@@ ures its success on their own .
we love wee@@ k@@ markets . we love small family businesses . we talk about regi@@ onal food food . we &apos;re eating be@@ o .
you &apos;ve been able to do a little bit about five years ago , because you &apos;ve always been able to bring the nutri@@ ents back .
that seemed to be the best way to tell my in@@ genu@@ ity , to make stories with my need to create images .
the first thing that came out was the first computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated software sur@@ fac@@ e that has ever shown in a movie .
that &apos;s what happens when you try to get those inter@@ rup@@ ted sources to say about 20 percent of the consumer .
the development has stopped in this industry some time , so it &apos;s not a surprise that some good concep@@ ts have happened around .
and if you put it in the ocean , and you start fil@@ ming , you get enough prop@@ ell@@ ence for the rema@@ ining life of the planet .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as that , but there &apos;s the mod@@ ular approach , which is another approach .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter sc@@ ill@@ man shares a design competition called &quot; the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge . &quot;
but you know , that &apos;s a serious thing , because this stuff is cra@@ p , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
it &apos;s self-@@ sel@@ fish , it &apos;s ug@@ ly , it &apos;s not wor@@ thy , and we need to really stop this .
but despite all those ti@@ de of work , there &apos;s a lot of cognitive , which is almost impossible to think about it , thinking about happiness .
and the surprise is that patient a has a much worse memory on the gut than patient b .
and yet , somehow they get the sen@@ sation that they should count what &apos;s happening during that sight of life .
we don &apos;t really have that in the real life , that feeling that in a finger@@ day clu@@ e , there are people ready to stand .
but to see it in the context , 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago , our first pri@@ mates began to go .
so , these are four super@@ power@@ s that lead to a single out@@ come . players are super powerful , hop@@ e@@ ful individuals .
and maybe nobody will never call god name , but what then does he want to do with the rest of his life ?
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can be re@@ gu@@ ined with its in@@ habit@@ ants and can do it .
that means that every day , if you have to wake up the morning , you have to decide what a kind of individual you want to be .
and what she found was a $ 10 investment fund that took the emplo@@ y@@ ment to take two percent apart .
the more possibilities there are , the simpl@@ est it is not to be able to do that for choice they make .
but one thing that he does is , every time you decide to decide , you don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and so the ima@@ gery is that it makes us better , and we feel worse , and we feel worse .
this is the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma that we all think is completely fal@@ se . it &apos;s not true .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard from many of them whose problem is not too large choice .
finally , just read this carto@@ on , and , a sophisti@@ cated person , says , &quot; ah ! what knows this fish ?
for@@ ned ph@@ ant@@ as@@ y , a shor@@ t-@@ down view of the world -- and that the way i read it first is how i read it first .
we have problems with food , with fresh and cle@@ an@@ able water , drugs , fuel for 6@@ .@@ 5 billion people .
now , engineers under them will look and say , &quot; no , they don &apos;t . these are little dr@@ um wir@@ es . &quot;
in one of the connections , between nin@@ th thousand magne@@ ts in the l@@ h@@ c , there was a man@@ en@@ com@@ po@@ und .
for example , they come up with me , and say , &quot; you don &apos;t know that you will never beat this success ?
the artist &apos;s artist was prote@@ cted to certain things , like , for example , too much nar@@ c@@ issu@@ y , right ?
and this is in many ways a symbol of the resi@@ stance of in@@ u@@ it and all occu@@ pa@@ irs on the world .
the so-@@ called ice , five years old , is almost like blood , which is out of the body here .
professor kat@@ ey wal@@ ter , on the university of al@@ as@@ ka , went to the other side of the sun at the other side of the sun .
one of the fa@@ st@@ est ways of our depen@@ dence upon ancient power , di@@ stor@@ ting our world .
he then got this hero , and in the co@@ operation with the museum , we went to the museum .
they go in the spirit through this house , in 19@@ k , and look at how many do@@ ors are there .
in this mind , we &apos;ve been re@@ vie@@ wing , and with this virtual images , imagination has been passed on .
they have no le@@ ad@@ -@@ land maps , but they &apos;ve been able to do that kind of geni@@ us hor@@ gl@@ ines or also sor@@ row sor@@ row .
and they are over the cent@@ u@@ ries over the cent@@ u@@ ries over the cent@@ u@@ ries over the cent@@ u@@ ries of machine age .
and that &apos;s what i thought is that i explor@@ ed the outside world , so i explor@@ ed the real world world .
not when i think of it here , when i think of local e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cally and the neighb@@ or is less going to work , it doesn &apos;t work .
and what really means , of course , intui@@ tively , and how does the cognitive process work ?
so much more natural , in a ves@@ sel , but i see , in a ves@@ sel , where is sal@@ alt and p@@ fe@@ p in it .
so , a very , very exciting process , like things that happen , and in a milli@@ meter of these things , things happen .
that &apos;s what everybody &apos;s doing all the time , but he &apos;s doing it un@@ conscious , and so , in part , instin@@ c@@ tively , instin@@ c@@ tively .
and so somebody like al gore , one of our great hero@@ es , there &apos;s nothing more important than to stabili@@ ze human population .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclu@@ sion that there &apos;s especially commun@@ ie@@ ties that go .
there is the u@@ ff@@ ian , the mom@@ a , the re@@ lie@@ ved , the van go@@ gh , the van go@@ gh .
very simple , they go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , this is called the power of zo@@ om -- they can zo@@ om in .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to make this as a swi@@ mming pool hole and the thing .
now , imagine half the people who want to live in dom@@ esti@@ c houses -- that &apos;s where the other half but not yet .
and the more we sele@@ ct , the way we will be able to practice the art of choice .
last year , the vas@@ que@@ z took a video that he had fil@@ med in the yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te national park in the yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te national park .
my mother was 18 when her father died -- in a ar@@ ran@@ ged marriage , with two little girls .
and the fe@@ ats were collap@@ sed between people who had one thing in common : they started re@@ acting .
my mother was ex@@ hau@@ sted every night , but we told each other about our day , and we heard the mov@@ ements of our grandmother in the house .
there was a energy , an un@@ pre@@ cious optimis@@ m of the gu@@ ards and the wa@@ g@@ gery .
i just sho@@ wer@@ ed in a hotel room in sy@@ d@@ ney , when she died , 1@@ 000 kilometers away in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
i see you as a puzz@@ le of reality , where you can take different pieces and put it together to create an alternative reality .
and these two pictures satis@@ fy them from the same al@@ titude , and the same ne@@ ar-@@ benefit .
the other thing that we would like to ask is that companies are helping us all over the world to help us do this pre@@ fer .
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out that we are very good at digital media with digital technology .
i became a great educ@@ ator -- i didn &apos;t -- but i had a lot of mu@@ muse@@ ums , and i had no access to that art@@ work .
now the average age of our bedro@@ cks is 28 , so i am , sa@@ dly , a generation older than most of them .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you find that the future is still in the year 2000 .
this is the communication that allowed for communities that were in the same boat , they were sy@@ ner@@ ge@@ tically .
and so , i can run a evolution about millions of years in the computer , or in more complex cases , some hours .
we talked about that there &apos;s nothing different than the age of the ancient indian dis@@ count , &quot; ma@@ hab@@ har@@ at@@ a . &quot;
the other view is not , anybody would deser@@ ve to kill death , but did we deser@@ ve to kill ?
i want to war@@ n you . this kind of identity of identity requires a lot more of us than if we don &apos;t care about it .
during the break , a police police off@@ ic@@ er came in , that the jan@@ it@@ ors were in court court .
here , in california , for example , in the next five years , there &apos;s a billion dollars for the death pen@@ al@@ ty , a billion dollars .
and if you look for your smar@@ t@@ phone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information as president clin@@ ton .
and i learned in my little to@@ ch@@ to@@ ad in the si@@ sters of the tor@@ onto tor@@ onto general , far from here .
other medical fun@@ ds that simil@@ arly , but the emergen@@ cy care is very , very common because we only see the patient .
my third little story story about the introdu@@ ction of the united king@@ dom in sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
and i went to sleep with this , and we made a lot of southern southern stars in the southern southern sea , and especially in the ja@@ vas@@ e@@ e .
we are asking the past , the people who can &apos;t access them , because the standards have changed , and very low .
but the more i thought about the question , i thought that there could be some fe@@ min@@ ine in a fe@@ min@@ ism .
so , they sent half of their civilization to a new world , so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion play hours per week .
we &apos;ve been te@@ sted with 1,@@ 700 gam@@ ers in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been recor@@ ding them over the last three years .
if you finish the game , you get off from the world bank , &quot; so@@ cially over@@ head , &quot; in 2010 .
but the most important thing is that between perception of our un@@ certain@@ ty and our great inv@@ derek spirit , there is a link .
now let us look at the wheel@@ chair , something which i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
i was 24 years old , and in most ways , as a mon@@ str@@ a , a mon@@ str@@ a dro@@ pped a sk@@ ill ride .
we put our esti@@ ma@@ tion out of the house , where , not surprising , he had gotten more awareness more attention than mine .
not all day will give us an opportunity to save a human being , but every day gives us the opportunity to change one .
and in the other case , the bar@@ ma is a chromo@@ some that hits the x chromo@@ some of the ice .
now they did that part , because they were part of a en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment system in the two things that had two things together .
h@@ ein@@ rich , on the other hand , is born on 19@@ 80 , 19@@ 80 , 19@@ 80 .
so we have this perman@@ ent an@@ atom@@ ic categ@@ ories that are very proble@@ matic in many ways and questi@@ on@@ able .
in our attemp@@ t to have democracy really well , and i think we would do our thing good in the future .
i ans@@ wer@@ ed him , &quot; well , you &apos;ve got political as@@ y@@ l in mention it , &quot; rather than separ@@ ating it ? &quot;
since years since i was interested in inter@@ sexu@@ ality , i also interested in research in the area of gender .
according to l@@ oud no@@ z@@ ot@@ us , games are , in the king@@ dom , li@@ di@@ ums were invented during a hun@@ gry .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that is made out of two parts -- a sen@@ sation of a fra@@ ction and a re@@ acting .
now , here &apos;s a picture of the building with the ima@@ gery of water and the proje@@ ctions of it .
or un@@ regular , but in three dimensions , where what &apos;s changed , the light is not the location of the ima@@ gery .
so here you see a real fl@@ y@@ fi@@ an-@@ controll@@ ing area that &apos;s coming down like before a regular v .
we also went to seven progra@@ mm@@ ers from around the world -- literally from all the cor@@ ners of the world -- to us .
and that &apos;s an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks beyond his life support system .
in the end of sand@@ sent , he gave us an email , &quot; for the first time for seven years , i &apos;ve created something .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this micro@@ phone , the e@@ ye@@ et -- everything was impossible at random .
and i re@@ gre@@ ted time , which i waste for meaning@@ less things that had a lot of people who mean something .
and after we &apos;ve been experim@@ enting with multiple kinds of che@@ ese , i went to see that this is a rec@@ ession .
so what we were looking for was the first thing we &apos;ve been looking for , because we know what these people are doing .
but why ? well , transpar@@ ency is fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing -- like this strange bak@@ er , which still brea@@ ks .
we &apos;re going to be both for men and for women , wheel@@ -@@ on , or a key , whatever .
all of those things come and start from a place , and for me , and begin with my family in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
and we went to school distri@@ ct , in which companies are in their way in ban@@ ned schools , in all america .
i personally do not accept that the building block of our time is for experts , and therefore decided to change that .
if you ask that question , the people in california need to be happ@@ ier when they say , in o@@ hi@@ o .
one day , the bo@@ f came to the company and asked if could i care about the sustain@@ ability of the farm .
so , i went to him . i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , how good you ta@@ iled your fish so well ? &quot;
you might say you &apos;re a reci@@ pe for the future , whether we &apos;re talking about bar@@ se or meat c@@ attle .
ar@@ th@@ ur c@@ lar@@ ke &apos;s law is obviously advanced technology and magic , not dist@@ antly dist@@ ant from each other .
there were people who said , well , we would have been able to do this oce@@ an-@@ to-@@ the-@@ planet , and put on the planet p@@ and@@ or@@ a on the planet .
all over@@ all , if we are optimi@@ stic , maybe we &apos;ll get a factor about three or maybe even a factor 6 or maybe a factor 6 .
they actually go through and create a frame where this can be discus@@ sed a frame , because we need support for all sides of it .
if the ab@@ str@@ ich you get , you can only get a very high power effect , you can only change the rich world .
and peter : nei@@ ther of the kids invest@@ ed time in the sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i g@@ m@@ b@@ h .
and one of them is , despite all our achie@@ vement in the world , a billion people in the world go to bed every day .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that &apos;s at least the 195@@ 0s in every magic book for children .
i &apos;m going to open up my hand , and hopefully , if everything will be good , the kni@@ fe will dete@@ ct through my na@@ ked magnetic magne@@ tis@@ m .
now , i &apos;m going to stick the need@@ le in my skin , and through them , through the other hand .
and the one that &apos;s worse was where the pain was at the end of the mountain , it &apos;s a bad story .
we know that happiness is mostly content with people that we like , time to spend time with people we like .
the artist gives them a portra@@ it in such a portra@@ it with what they &apos;re all going to be familiar with when they look at this art@@ work .
is there an opportunity that the land would generate gener@@ ually a evidence like the serious , and based on politics ?
now , it seems to me , this top@@ ic , or should at least the most interesting political debate about the next few years .
and if you do that , they &apos;re sho@@ cked by actually being able to do that . this is an epi@@ l@@ ant vic@@ tory .
we are getting more in play worl@@ ds . i mean , in the relationship with motivation , to do something significant to connect with each other .
but always on the edge of their cap@@ abilities , you have to get ti@@ ed up , but there are no working lo@@ om in world of war@@ craft .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to be less than a mass of mass in virtual worl@@ ds and online environments . &quot;
clearly , there was such a large fam@@ ine that the king of ly@@ di@@ ums decided to cho@@ se a crazy idea .
so i immediately decided to call these online recor@@ ds from 2009 and expect me to find a contribu@@ tion here .
in fact , even a human ei@@ gh@@ ty than child , it could ab@@ and@@ on them , put them in and post them to them .
i went back to my pre@@ y , where i hit my des@@ per@@ e , and i met my belo@@ ved dog .
this is just a little taste on the insi@@ ghts that bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are taking us into our past .
i &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the types of gender people that don &apos;t occu@@ r to the male or female standards .
typical of all , our system is based on the idea that a particular at@@ tribu@@ tion comes in with a particular identity .
they &apos;ve got a fat under the nose , and when they moved , they haven &apos;t bu@@ ried her yet .
h@@ ein@@ rich needs to wait for all of those , because he actually has a different biological age , only based on the time of his birth .
so , i don &apos;t have to plan them in the field , but i can also impro@@ v@@ ise it ; they cur@@ ren@@ der , or sal@@ es@@ si@@ le .
their h@@ unter@@ s could smell the ur@@ ine of a 40 re@@ mot@@ eness , smell and define what animal types of that thought was .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you &apos;re going to go to do@@ c and tell them what to do .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re interested with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i mar@@ ry , or not ? should i married ?
no one in the world of marketing knows this , because if you would , all of them don &apos;t know what it was here .
income distribution is going to make it better -- not just the poor -- because all that big sele@@ ction gives us bil@@ ls .
by hit@@ ting the wir@@ es , and 13@@ -@@ thousand am@@ p@@ ples suddenly , electr@@ onal resi@@ stance , electr@@ onal resi@@ stance .
and even the ones that don &apos;t actually su@@ i@@ cide , they had been su@@ l@@ ted by their talent .
don &apos;t feel comfortable with that ? because with only one centi@@ meter , i don &apos;t feel at all comfortable with this idea .
for the first time in history , you hear people call a geni@@ us -- rather than that he has a geni@@ us .
maybe we can er@@ ase rational human@@ ism for a thousand years of human@@ ism in an 18@@ -@@ minute talk .
it &apos;s mer@@ ely an aging age of pain , and maybe he &apos;ll never get back to this hei@@ ghts .
and the dis@@ ast@@ ers all over the world have been very extraordinary and un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented ex@@ ecu@@ tives .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of tons of co2 -- 25 million tons of tons every day in the oceans .
for christ@@ mas day , at home in ten@@ nes@@ see , a billion tons of coal .
he can put new characters in the scene , using the si@@ de@@ walk from the table that shows this character .
all those people teach us that there are other kinds of existence , other ways of thinking on the planet on earth .
and then finally , i can finish up the whole sequence by which i tend to close the lou@@ d@@ lock si@@ cker on the left .
but actually , it &apos;s always about finding a lo@@ ck@@ able access to having a play@@ ful version of it .
that was intui@@ tive , so everyone just had the wi@@ sh@@ es , and what &apos;s going on him , expres@@ sed , then expres@@ sed .
arch@@ a@@ ic cognitive models is that the models that we &apos;ve been looking at in the pre-@@ industrial times .
we had the vo@@ iled age , we &apos;ve got the machine age , and we now decided to describe the cyber@@ age age .
and on the le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand , and then finally , i hope that no sugar in it is to give the sal@@ alt .
i &apos;ve got that sort of cognitive feedback , you &apos;ve got what you want to see .
so , there &apos;s a cat@@ ingu@@ ge@@ ty of produ@@ c@@ tivity , so as for@@ mal spo@@ ts or for@@ mal@@ tic aspe@@ cts , or for@@ mal@@ tic@@ ic aspe@@ cts .
there we tend to be on the con@@ cer@@ tin@@ a level , which we think of as , of course , con@@ cre@@ te .
i &apos;ll get the whole over@@ look , and i can say , &quot; just show me all the thing about cho@@ col@@ ate . &quot;
if we think about the way we think about the he@@ ck , our entire world is going to be a pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful .
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on the planet , wei@@ gh@@ ing about four times more than us .
so if you take these sounds , they cut them smaller , ster@@ ili@@ ty and pul@@ se , to plant trees .
it has to be for me in this room and now , i can &apos;t be able to convince my audience that this is my conc@@ ern .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to make a lot of music , and as the audience , you know , like the music of life .
you know , oh my goo@@ dness , we &apos;ll be dro@@ pping up 70 percent of mobile phones in developing 20@@ 13 to the end of 20@@ 13 .
in fact , a way that we don &apos;t really understand the recei@@ ver , the ability to en@@ code information .
they &apos;ve learned the reci@@ pe of the cell as information , and in a particular chemical form that we call dna .
so to give you an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program which is made out of random in@@ struc@@ tions .
and when i say no , she would leave me . when i said &quot; yes , she left me . &quot;
then he took a drink of be@@ er and his sister , and she as@@ sum@@ ed , and then she ad@@ mit@@ ted to me .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a law@@ yer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re law@@ yer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
and as humans , we are much better at looking at problems at very long term , but they usually come to over@@ come .
and on this cur@@ ve , on the bac@@ ks of mo@@ ore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to everyone .
ladies and gentle@@ men , we live on a planet of 5@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ mile times more energy than we use every year .
do we really believe that we can do what we need to do without impro@@ ving the institution of us in the name of us ?
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amin@@ o aci@@ ds to explore how the protein is going to grow .
but what we &apos;re doing is that each one of them , including in the world , would be perfect to the world .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we make the mistakes out of the drug that we make a sa@@ fer system .
and in the west , we couldn &apos;t understand how anyone could do that , and how much the freedom would be re@@ lie@@ ved .
and as we today , in the year of 2011 , we like our governments , it &apos;s right that we dis@@ count forever , for gran@@ ted .
they put us in the position to build things bigger than we were , buildings , bri@@ d@@ ges , bri@@ d@@ ges , bri@@ d@@ ges , bri@@ d@@ ges , a bri@@ ck after others .
in fact , le@@ go has basically the con@@ cre@@ te rock , the building block of the world , and made a building block for our imagination .
take the switch out of a pul@@ se , which is there , and you &apos;ve got a little blind man .
so one of the intui@@ tions that you &apos;ve been evol@@ ving is that one thing that you might be able to be only at a place at the same time .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like every at@@ om out there will be two , a sen@@ sor and a driver .
and you can approach him , and it &apos;s going to open up to make it happen , as you see in this picture .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization , and a lot of things , we &apos;ve reach@@ ed some things .
in my own humanity and with my mis@@ mis@@ sions , i reach@@ ed to get better in everything i grab@@ bed .
when we started working our research six months ago , it was completely un@@ known , which was the point and purpose of this moment@@ um .
and we also realized that they were very profession@@ ally constru@@ cted by people who suff@@ ered all the information information .
anyway , we found out that both digital thre@@ at@@ heads are actually based on one plus the same goal , but from different direc@@ ts .
r@@ al@@ ph , it became a lot of repor@@ ts that people thought that mo@@ s@@ thes@@ es are the main organization of the center .
this is from a show that pa@@ ol@@ a ant@@ on@@ ell@@ i for mom@@ a later , during the summer , organized .
this thing has the ability to be in quant@@ um mechan@@ ical position , but it needs a little bit of some help to do it .
this is a picture of den@@ den@@ ver , and the sk@@ et@@ ch represents the new air@@ port that was built in den@@ se .
it &apos;s already been working on a legal system that management regu@@ late , and it &apos;s also been working on an ex@@ tern@@ ali@@ ties system .
if i ask you a question , you know , because i &apos;m blind , only hand if you want to burn a few cal@@ ories .
but after all , it &apos;s how we can be interpre@@ ted the world , and how it can be made on a two-@@ dimensional space .
thir@@ dly , it &apos;s not possible to make it happen to dist@@ ingu@@ ish where the individual images start and end by conne@@ cting them clo@@ th@@ less@@ ly .
and one of the things that we introduced in the bi@@ d-@@ b@@ ou@@ di@@ c university was to put a major listen@@ er .
and then se@@ attle decided to use the ap@@ p to get the citizens to get the cont@@ amin@@ ated gul@@ f .
na@@ than my@@ hr@@ v@@ old and i fin@@ ance a company that might surprise the nuclear approach , the nuclear approach .
if we turn off this el , then you don &apos;t have those ro@@ tat@@ ing mass , which causes a certain in@@ ju@@ ti@@ ty in the web .
if you don &apos;t have that anymore , these ro@@ tat@@ ing mass , then you have to replace this with power electr@@ on@@ ics and electro@@ chemical .
he &apos;d just had a dem@@ o of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s first and a quar@@ ter dec@@ line , and came behind the stage to imagine myself .
and the power of the music brought him back into a family of musi@@ cians that recogni@@ zed his talent , and she was paying attention to him .
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said , &quot; we are so far out that the waste of our fish is not concent@@ r@@ ated . &quot;
it &apos;s the roman@@ tic way that you know the way you know your fish , your fish lo@@ ves the fish .
and no , he hasn &apos;t coo@@ ked the fish , and he &apos;s not co@@ ok , at least on the way they and i understand .
and you don &apos;t understand me wrong , which was really fascinating , you know , bio@@ tic community , in the way , in the way .
and if it &apos;s strug@@ gl@@ ed through the system , and it &apos;s the water that it comes in , as it comes from .
my response to that was drawing and painting by alien , alien worl@@ ds , robots , spac@@ ec@@ raft and all this stuff .
at the same time , i was also interested in space science , which was again the science fi@@ ction effect of my childhood .
that &apos;s all the conc@@ ern for you . don &apos;t make it yourself , bet not yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
only different economic changes have changed at all , and we need to slow down from ra@@ pid rise to zero .
so , if you &apos;ve got to dep@@ end on these sources , you have a way to get energy in times when you &apos;re not available .
so we need a big break@@ through here , which is a factor that will be better than 100 times better than the approach to the time .
we can start to integra@@ te electric mo@@ bility , and let &apos;s say , &quot; well , let &apos;s put the load down . &quot;
thank you very much . just to understand ter@@ ra@@ power , you can give us an idea of scale of that investment ?
cat@@ astrop@@ ha@@ l because of this fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vac@@ cin@@ ation comes down to mas@@ ses .
they take the stuff , and they take an alternative , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference how many times we are out there are use .
and as we would use it , it seemed to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that kee@@ ps memory ourselves .
the impli@@ cation of what i &apos;ve been saying is that we shouldn &apos;t actually imagine ourselves as a re@@ plac@@ ement for well-@@ being .
it &apos;s hard to think about well-@@ being , and i hope i &apos;ve con@@ je@@ cted a taste of how hard it is .
an ep@@ ic vic@@ tory is a result that is so positive that they didn &apos;t know that they didn &apos;t even know it was possible at all .
players always believe that an epi@@ c vic@@ tory is possible , and that it always worth looking forward to trying and make it happen .
here &apos;s a back@@ ward forma@@ tion to put that into the right light . you know , you know all wikipedia , the largest wi@@ ki of the world .
we should survive in it that half of us are bringing an hour to play with games per day , until we solved the problems of real world .
i &apos;m going to show you three games , which i &apos;ve created to try to create people epi@@ c in their own future .
so what we &apos;ve been looking at for the next world world is a bigger dest@@ ination than only there is oil shor@@ tage .
the call appe@@ aled to ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence , we have almost like &quot; jer@@ alo@@ y-@@ bru@@ ck@@ cure film &quot; film .
you see , it really only takes a human being to show you how you &apos;re able to get their forces mani@@ fest , and you &apos;re through .
suppose i said that through a few changes of their genes , a better memory could be -- pre@@ cise , more and faster .
and today , i had time to show them a part of this new design world and some of the possibility of the world that we work on in our lab .
and then you ask them , &quot; well , how you put your ta@@ xic@@ om@@ y , and you say , &quot; i thought you were going to understand something from plants .
so , it turns out that you take any number of these 17 var@@ ie@@ ties on full moon , and you sing them in a different microscop@@ e .
this is , i think , so deeply in our water supp@@ lies , that it would not make a question that would make it a question .
the answer is , you expect to call the doctor next morning and ask a change to ask a change .
i &apos;d like to say -- a short car bi@@ ograph@@ er -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful .
if hundreds of different kinds of je@@ ans are available , and they ask them why , who is responsible ?
there is no question that is a little bit better than no , but it doesn &apos;t follow it , but it does not follow the choices better than a sele@@ ction .
but that &apos;s a reci@@ g@@ ged by a metaphor of orange fish glass is a reci@@ pe for par@@ ent , and , i guess , cat@@ astrop@@ he .
in other words , as we saw this picture on september 10@@ th , we knew that the machine was working , which is a large tri@@ um@@ ph .
about a week later , there was a problem with this wir@@ es -- these golden wir@@ es wir@@ es down here -- these golden wir@@ es here .
at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 degrees , it &apos;s hot@@ ter than the room between the stars , that dr@@ um can prevent .
is it ration@@ ure that it should be afraid that he &apos;s got sc@@ ared to do the work he feels about ?
she knew that they could only do one that , and that was -- in their words , the de@@ vil@@ s are the he@@ ck .
in the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as , the third largest ice shel@@ f , you see the rise of new la@@ kes that were there a few years ago .
these are some children who came to the media lab , and i could move her to pull it and took a video .
every language is like the ol@@ d-@@ growth forest of mind , a second point of mind , a thought of spi@@ ritual possibilities .
computers ha@@ ck , and then it &apos;s always going to be like the ha@@ cker somewhere somewhere , and so on .
there &apos;s a group of in@@ don@@ es@@ ia on the bottom is a group of in@@ don@@ es@@ ia , which means that there are , but there &apos;s been a pretty long time .
and we actually tried to put that back in the acade@@ mic world , but there &apos;s somehow not that close .
so , i think we are in the bio@@ ha@@ cker scen@@ es , and i think that &apos;s a step further than the acade@@ mic world .
sh@@ y , p@@ rie@@ sts , so-@@ called the knowledge of knowledge , was re@@ lie@@ ved to preser@@ ve knowledge in stories .
and of course , that &apos;s conf@@ using us , because we see the other media , social media media media , and so on .
that &apos;s why they are all those who are and curious , in fact people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
every day , they give them scale to roughly two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us , and every day , they need two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us .
today , i &apos;m going to show you what else i &apos;m talking about , so i &apos;m going to think of myself in a verb@@ al language , more than a verb@@ al language .
he &apos;s cros@@ sed the se@@ rus very recently , as he saw her , like that in this moment she was doing it in this moment .
and what happens when you play a piece of , a hundred years ago , a hundred years ago ?
today , a modern orche@@ str@@ a is able to play everything , which was an orche@@ str@@ a re@@ per@@ toi@@ re at the same time .
and not only in art , in the vol@@ th@@ mic , in the middle of the my@@ th@@ ology , in stories , it comes back up .
and if we are in fr@@ fur@@ t , then i remember the ma@@ x plan institute for brain research .
and we &apos;ve just started with a relatively simpli@@ stic human story , where you could spend a memory that &apos;s worth a memory of memory today .
the next morning , i wo@@ ke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i was just dre@@ aming this crazy thing , and actually written it .
at that point , we have multi-@@ in@@ formed communities , communities of many different different cells that combin@@ ed them together as a single organis@@ m .
so the nervous system has the evolutionary process of this particular information system because evolution could be able to occu@@ r within an individual .
we &apos;re using these programs now to make the computers much faster , so we can be able to do the processes even faster .
i was afraid that i could lose the ability to make the sun happen without the camera and without t@@ we@@ et to my friends .
and so i fell into the world of technology to see how i could use it to kill magic instead of killing .
then he looked at me and said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not always mad because of the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
we have a ju@@ g@@ ger in this country to treat a lot better when you &apos;re rich and gu@@ il@@ ty than poor and inno@@ cent .
and after the terror@@ ism of all of course , the ra@@ c@@ ist was motiv@@ ating and for decades of pri@@ st@@ ful sub@@ mission , and a@@ par@@ thei@@ d .
because we actually talk about that , we need more hope , more engagement , more to be able to get into a complex world .
i thought my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; m@@ um mm . &quot;
i also believe that in many parts of the country , in many parts of the world , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
and the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information invol@@ ves information over the time of 2.@@ 5 billion years ago that they &apos;ve been born .
when i put the sta@@ irs up , there was an el@@ der@@ ly , black man who had home@@ bo@@ yo@@ r on court .
it tou@@ ched me a little deeply deep myself , identity , the ability to contribu@@ te each individual to a community of hope .
the rich@@ est capit@@ alists in the last century , the im@@ per@@ at@@ at@@ ers of the earth would have been able to dream such as lux@@ ury goods .
that &apos;s why the tele@@ phone costs about a million times less , and it &apos;s thousands of times faster than a super@@ computer from the 197@@ 0s .
the cha@@ irs of co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a has just been jo@@ ined a large test project with a hundred un@@ its in developing countries .
and just by the way , the largest in@@ sur@@ ance of a population explo@@ sion is a better education and nutri@@ tion around the world .
there &apos;s a couple of things , especially when you think about it , you &apos;re working in a hospital that only had 14 patients per day at that time .
on the y-@@ axis is a few good things : bio@@ diversity , number of or@@ ca , the green of your country , the water supply .
so the people who see a sea prote@@ cted area and benefit from the insi@@ ght of the insi@@ ghts that allow it to rec@@ ru@@ it their own nature .
as the con@@ cre@@ te block allows us to build a lot larger , more complex cir@@ cles , a bri@@ ck for the other .
my circle started in the &apos; 6@@ 0s at high school in the &apos; 6@@ 0s , o@@ hi@@ o , where i was the classroom .
sol@@ d@@ on : with the h@@ ul@@ c@@ -@@ ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on , i can carry 200 pounds of ter@@ rain , many hours long .
and when you obser@@ ved bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in the game , the evolutionary orig@@ ins are human la@@ ch@@ ens , dan@@ cing and ritu@@ als .
we &apos;ve got very hard clas@@ sages no@@ wa@@ days -- maybe not so many things like this in medicine -- the question is , when do someone be dead ?
so to tell you about this an@@ x@@ iety , i have to know first that i &apos;m a big fan of the green world .
sometimes people tell me , i &apos;ll look as if i had d@@ ressed the games , and i remember her se@@ ven@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds .
just by the way , i just want to say that cities are only two percent of the world &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population live there .
some of you remember , it was as it@@ em@@ y for fr@@ ance , and then finally , the head of head .
now , this is just an example of how we could feel the city today , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
the cloud is again a cloud in the same way that a real cloud has a cloud of particles in the same way .
if you look at ice mountain , you think of it being isol@@ ated , separate and alone , just like human beings tend to see us .
i &apos;ve come to understand the sen@@ ti@@ ments of george bur@@ den who read in las v@@ eg@@ as &apos;s show in the &apos; 9@@ 0s .
the third thing i learned -- and that &apos;s when the clock is starting , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , five -- &quot; to count .
one thing i truly believe is , if you take a chance , you can take risks that are possible in these risks .
so , i suggest@@ ed that governments create new areas that provide enough space for a city and gave them a name : char@@ ter cities .
she grew up at a time when con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism was the social nor@@ m , and the local mand@@ ar@@ in was the most important person .
or the pictures like this -- dark and far@@ med , but everyone with the common goal is to keep a reali@@ stic spot .
and today , we don &apos;t just want to call this as an a@@ ed@@ 4@@ u , like the products , but also as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ us .
and the next thing that we got was , &quot; i went over there , found the g@@ arb@@ age ton@@ ne behind the house .
and this is a new idea that we need to use this guy on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ve in the area of technology .
when i was a kid , there was a lot of the time in 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in the year 2000 .
because i think this is really understanding , we have to take a step back and look at the issue on a longer scale .
according to 18 years , the fam@@ ine hasn &apos;t been better . so the king was going to take a last box .
so the sphere of my existence was as a maker fi@@ ction fan , then as a child , and the imple@@ ment@@ ation in reality .
that &apos;s the way i &apos;d like to leave you with the way . fail is an alternative , fear is not . thank you .
but for the first three fac@@ tors , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion tons of sound , and that &apos;s simply not enough .
the hard step is to build the first re@@ actor , to find a new billion , the regul@@ ari@@ ans and the location of the site actually build the first of it .
bill , i &apos;m talking to myself for almost all people here , i hope you wish your wish will be true . thank you very much .
the reason is , i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and &quot; devices &quot; to build .
one child that can be born in new del@@ hi in new del@@ hi just to live as long as the rich@@ est man in the world before 100 years ago .
it &apos;s not about our ridi@@ cul@@ ous passion for hor@@ mon@@ es , our hard food , better food , better food .
so , after that incredible , you might want to say , &quot; do you want to still go into this ridi@@ cul@@ ous time machine , and go to the future ? &quot;
so , it &apos;s exactly right here , where my meat starts , i &apos;m just going to make a little embar@@ ras@@ sing on my arm .
why we se@@ ek the vac@@ u@@ re that we &apos;re looking for is a problem that makes us a choice between the two species of self .
i think the most interesting thing that we found out in the gall@@ up is a number that we had absolutely not found .
i have a plan for it , and i want to convince more people , including all of them , more time with play , more time .
i call it the &quot; in life , &quot; i &apos;m sick face , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? ok .
you know , there &apos;s a cause why the average word of war@@ cra@@ cra@@ -@@ players are 22 hours a week , as part as sharing job .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again , and every time it makes it larger , it &apos;s larger than the sum of the dat@@ es .
and of course , it hat@@ s the heart to hear that rever@@ se students were told , they &apos;re just suff@@ i@@ cient .
and by the time we talk about bacteria , they realize that each one of us in our gut is taking more bacteria in the rest of our bodies ?
and very important , with the introdu@@ ction of sexual re@@ production , the rest of the body is going to cut off the rest of the body .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily pri@@ al the biggest , the stron@@ gest or the fa@@ st@@ est , and not once the smar@@ test .
so we thought that we were going to embra@@ ce ourselves to this challenge and make an ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on that would help with this problem .
but it was still a twi@@ t@@ win@@ ess against the other volunte@@ ers to try and figure out what our challenges would be .
they &apos;ve actually come up with , because that &apos;s what explains an ab@@ und@@ ant toler@@ ant society , in the de@@ ad@@ ly violence of violence .
the reason that many different kinds of sur@@ gical sur@@ gical proce@@ dur@@ es are , because they thre@@ aten our social categ@@ ories .
we have difficult talking about what a body will be to human beings , so he &apos;s got another right than the fe@@ tus life .
i &apos;m political pro@@ gressi@@ ve , i de@@ ath@@ s@@ essed people with unusual bodies , but i have to ad@@ mit it makes me feel nervous .
again , all sorts of skin colors that occu@@ r in an@@ atom@@ ic shapes is , again , successful .
and one of the things that i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and in the world .
it &apos;s not a death , if you s@@ hr@@ ink ; it &apos;s not a finish , but a continu@@ um of the way through the life cycle .
can you come to o@@ hi@@ o , and please come together with the guy that i know you &apos;ve found out of it .
and i should mention that i &apos;ve been building memory cancer , and i want them to ask them . &quot;
and the commercial device costs about five thousand euro@@ s or something like that , sa@@ wu@@ der pen@@ e@@ print around the five .
there was a time when i was a young boy , and you could have been able to have any tele@@ phones that you wanted to get as long as it came from ma bell .
my ja@@ w was down and after i said , &quot; i would have liked the way the only way it was . &quot;
ad@@ ding opportunities to the life of people &apos;s lives inevi@@ t@@ ably , the expec@@ tations of the people have been good at how good the possibility will be .
we &apos;ve engine@@ ered the pieces that we could easily break them with enzy@@ mes . there are enzy@@ mes that re@@ pair them and put them together again .
we knew from a mechan@@ ism of the hom@@ ology , which is called the biology to fix dna , that can fit pieces like this .
these are more than 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters in genetic code , which is the largest molecule that has ever been created by humans .
this is a picture of effective design software that we &apos;re actually working on , and to design new species on the computer .
that &apos;s the kind of thinking that you can get someone to catch at nine a@@ .@@ m@@ . , and that &apos;s not what i want .
in these opportunities , the po@@ em came in and in@@ t@@ act on paper -- but back@@ wards -- from the last word to the first word .
they put together the hands together , and they started sing@@ ing , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , god , god , god .
as you see , it &apos;s growing on the dark blue , which is a year in winter , and it s@@ hr@@ un@@ k in summer .
much more importantly , are em@@ power@@ s , which is why you can only put them through the exten@@ sion of the hands and access .
and i &apos;ve got a lec@@ ture on the other hand in cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen in the medical museum in combin@@ ation with an exhi@@ bi@@ tion .
that &apos;s actually not necessary , because each one of them has been highly evolved technology as most of the electr@@ on technology that &apos;s really like this .
gen@@ st-@@ gun , yes , like a kind of an air prin@@ ting gun , which sho@@ ws about so far , two centi@@ meters or something like that .
until the day today , they &apos;re going to gover@@ n from a ritual p@@ rie@@ p , but the training is very extraordinary .
and it &apos;s that i &apos;m looking at a city , by looking at where places are positive or negative .
and that is , of course , where you start and look and say , okay , i just look into the inner self .
so you really need to make a lot of look , if i want to use something friend@@ ly , or intui@@ tively , what does this mean at the heart .
and when i tell someone , give me s@@ alt or p@@ fe@@ p , then he &apos;s going to be thinking about where &apos;s in there .
then it goes into the past , and so i can war@@ p very elegan@@ t at the computer , for example , when i know this phenomenon .
that means that i can just trans@@ fer such an intui@@ tive , human arti@@ fact , and make the software much better .
it uses each of us , and o@@ zone is an ac@@ r@@ ony@@ m , and it stands for ori@@ entation , and in@@ formed , trans@@ actions .
i can now gui@@ de that mental hand@@ ling model , sel@@ ec@@ tive , trans@@ actions trans@@ mit@@ ting to an interaction system .
i &apos;m really interested in this , and this is all about the environ@@ ment@@ ation of the world , four years of clu@@ b@@ al re@@ pos@@ it@@ ation , in quality of it .
we &apos;re trying to mini@@ mi@@ ze our e@@ col@@ o@@ gical foot@@ print , but it &apos;s about having a large foot@@ print that &apos;s useful .
you &apos;re reading in the letters , du@@ mp@@ s , or whether it words , thoughts from the com@@ pos@@ er themselves .
every text , every sentence takes a sense , because i percei@@ ve it myself , because it comes from my own personal opportunity .
you may know this idea of the lady that looked at each tomorrow in the mirror , and she asked him who &apos;s the most beautiful thing about all over the country ?
the question was , in fact , that was a two-@@ mile line , the first time that we did this with the island , just compu@@ te through it .
he said , &quot; yes , fe@@ a@@ thers , skin , bat@@ -@@ kn@@ our , re@@ sts , dri@@ es and food . &quot;
now , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have a lot of problems -- climate crisis , poverty -- and energy problems -- we already have that .
i colle@@ cted a little team of people around me who car@@ ried the bo@@ xes , &quot; not an in@@ sti@@ ble challenge . &quot;
so the question i want to ask you is , if you look at these exponenti@@ al cur@@ ves , you don &apos;t see it forever .
and i &apos;ve got over 100 micro@@ gra@@ ms of a white pul@@ se , which i &apos;m trying to main@@ tain in air@@ por@@ ts from security .
they started creating speci@@ alists in the community , specifically , which were responsible for learning and understanding that information from information .
and it conne@@ cts us all to something that is much bigger , and also capable of creating faster than we &apos;ve been .
we are at one point , the il@@ o@@ g is at the time , as one-@@ cell organisms evolved multi-@@ cell organisms .
and again , a letter goes down to me -- and the i@@ pad knows through gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
we &apos;ve heard all of fe@@ es and n@@ y@@ mp@@ es , but how many people know their indian colleagues , the apple of their indian colleagues ?
this is the kind@@ ma@@ tion being brought back . you have to go out in a chap@@ ter , a photograph of a flo@@ wer and tag .
to me , the time is to take time and talk about the poor people who are not supposed to be at ted .
so i spoke to ju@@ g@@ und@@ ment and education , and the idea of mar@@ g@@ in@@ alized and in@@ formed .
and charles ken@@ ny is the alp@@ hab@@ e@@ ti@@ zation rate in 25 percent by 25 percent of 80 percent .
we bring our students into these technologies , with special focus on how this could be used to solve the major challenges facing humanity .
i resi@@ sted in a hospital hospital in tor@@ onto as a woman in tor@@ onto the hospital department of hospitals in the emergen@@ cy department .
so , i sig@@ ned up a hospital ta@@ p and a hospital and res@@ cu@@ e assi@@ stant and brought them home .
there was lots of about 20 centi@@ meters , black sk@@ et@@ ch chip , a sub@@ species of state .
fis@@ her@@ ic fish were very sophisti@@ cated , and the fis@@ her@@ men lived very well on ghana , deser@@ ved in ghana .
groups like anony@@ mous are over@@ come over the last 12 months , and they have become one of the major players on the field of online ang@@ ri@@ cs .
the most beautiful thing is how you start to understand the electr@@ on@@ ics that you &apos;re facing in the everyday day , and you don &apos;t know it in school .
so , for example , we had a designer with nothing in electr@@ onic things that started playing with li@@ tt@@ ing@@ ness as material .
which brings me to the second technology that helps them deal with the problem of choice , it &apos;s the con@@ cre@@ tion .
i have friends who make large , gigan@@ tic hollywood movies , and i have friends who make little n@@ gos movies like me .
now , we can &apos;t be all the tom@@ -@@ brand , but i &apos;m looking at myself at the interface &apos;s interface , and i &apos;m looking at a lot of ad@@ ver@@ ts .
i believe that if you were co@@ ach@@ ing your employees , you &apos;re going to pre@@ tend the whole company to make a profit .
it would be a terrible model for a partic@@ le physi@@ ci@@ sts , because they don &apos;t play with bu@@ lli@@ ons , but with these little strange particles .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal it &apos;s like a jum@@ p@@ board , and it stands over the edge over the edge .
i went a little clean space with new si@@ ci@@ ans , and ra@@ cking for a hundred hours of all the big devices .
the first thing that is the importance of law , laws that define you already don &apos;t have exi@@ sting living ow@@ ners .
sometimes , sometimes children are sometimes trying to figure out their parents that they have , in some cases , for a decade or a decade .
so in these places , we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 se@@ ats that people have lost anything between two to 5@@ 5@@ 8@@ ,000 sub@@ scri@@ p@@ ts .
what happened was that the sphere was closed , it was a circle -- and the offen@@ sion of that i &apos;ve been talking about .
why are people talking about 15@@ ,000 to 30 percent , if they &apos;re using an ec@@ a map or a card card , when they are money ?
if you think that the left is in@@ fer@@ red , and the ad on the right , you cla@@ p them into the hands .
if you think that the one on the left is ja@@ zz , and the one on the ri@@ ght-@@ hand side is cla@@ pping , then you cla@@ p them .
hi . i &apos;m kev@@ in allo@@ c@@ ca , on youtube , i &apos;m looking at youtube video videos .
we all want to be stars -- famous , sing@@ le-@@ edi@@ ans -- when i was young , so infin@@ itely difficult .
so a whole re@@ mix community took la@@ pped out of the ground that made it a little healthy jo@@ ke to something that we could all be partici@@ p@@ ating in .
so that was completely surprising and un@@ mor@@ t@@ ated , cas@@ ey was s@@ las@@ h of the idea and his argument about five million times .
and these are not the characteri@@ stics of the old media , and they &apos;re not going to make the media happen , but they are going to define the conversation of the future .
it &apos;s a po@@ et , a writer , a guy whose entire life of the simple hope of on@@ eness and freedom was co@@ iled .
and to make sure that there &apos;s nothing like my sle@@ ist , i &apos;m just going to put my wr@@ ist up here .
but don &apos;t think about lying the gap as you may have heard of them , if people say no one has a wall to build a wall .
because as they are working , they realize that they cannot prove that there &apos;s no predi@@ ction , the man is very happy .
but something like &quot; n solar pen@@ del s come out of the square feet , that was a to@@ y . &quot;
now we &apos;ve got over about 10 million of them , and we &apos;ve got about 10 me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t-@@ bat@@ ri@@ t-@@ bat@@ t-@@ type battery now to ger@@ man networks .
and all right , i just want to encoura@@ ge you to feel a little bit mad , and also have a certain vision .
it was as though he was under an un@@ seen ar@@ ran@@ e , a chemical response , whose cat@@ aly@@ st that was my game .
it was a beautiful fish , goo@@ vor@@ y , rich , deli@@ ber@@ ate , a pol@@ ession on the men@@ u .
the plant bio@@ mass , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , that &apos;s what the fish are fe@@ eding .
i &apos;m a lan@@ ce arm@@ strong , so i &apos;m going to tell you what i &apos;m talking about here , all of those fail@@ ures in that lan@@ ce arm@@ strong is mentioned to me .
in fact , in a particular type of sum@@ mar@@ i@@ ties , i can go into the subject of time magazine , &quot; human beings go into this year , &quot; and everyone else looks like this .
with il@@ m , we created the guy out of liquid metal , success was all about how this effect was happening .
and why ? because they understand them , they are three-@@ rein@@ mi@@ ous ge@@ om@@ et@@ ric ima@@ gery , the key to build stable structures .
cher@@ no@@ by@@ l , b@@ hop@@ al , the challen@@ ger , vi@@ ox@@ x , mass destruction , the u.s. pres@@ identi@@ al ele@@ ction .
and it doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infe@@ cted with a paraly@@ sis of the disease , and we don &apos;t know that , because that &apos;s the way the world actually works .
everything that we eat , every ri@@ ce , every p@@ ink of pe@@ ter@@ y , was changed by the people .
so people who have never felt , they have never felt individu@@ ally with their own bodies , which is to make a clay .
right ? a sy@@ r@@ inge with an effective -- a few milli@@ su@@ es of an effective sub@@ stance that you &apos;re inje@@ cted to a patient .
and none of it has some really pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical characteri@@ stics . it &apos;s just our faith in making a stron@@ ger effect .
this is 18 in@@ ches long ; it &apos;s very , very shar@@ p , and i &apos;m going to start it a little bit of a little bit ster@@ ili@@ ty .
because we asked these people , they ask them , &quot; how bad was the whole thing over@@ all ? &quot;
the recogni@@ tion is slow in the united states , no question , but in the united king@@ dom , it &apos;s happening in the u.@@ k , and in other countries it &apos;s happening .
so far , the world of war@@ cra@@ cra@@ tz@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years trying to solve virtual problems of a@@ cer@@ ly .
the reason is , if we are playing , we actually are happ@@ ier working , as if we rela@@ x@@ ed or doing nothing .
and according to them , they survi@@ ved this fam@@ ously for 18 years , by sitting on a day , and the next day .
evolution has been an issue on the ted conference , but today i &apos;m going to show you the idea of a drug on the subject .
as chimpanze@@ es from large , sc@@ ler@@ ks will be led , the bon@@ o@@ bo society will run the bon@@ o@@ bo society of mur@@ dered fe@@ males .
i want you to imagine two pa@@ irs , the middle 197@@ 0s , exactly the same day , every single baby -- okay , every single baby -- okay .
so , the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like so@@ custom@@ ers , the way i &apos;m talking about , &quot; am i not wife ? &quot;
let &apos;s imagine that one of them was born , mar@@ ia , three months later , she was born on jun@@ e 19@@ 80 .
the united states provi@@ ders un@@ belie@@ vable opportunities to allow people to change them , without changing the fact that they are .
kir@@ d-@@ hand@@ -@@ sh@@ opp@@ ing allo@@ cation allo@@ wing me to reduce the power of my goo@@ son on the community , and also put it on my wal@@ lets .
do you have no fear of writing your entire life , and you never want to create anything in the world anybody interested in the world ? does it va@@ se ?
so one day , she jo@@ ined out of a ban@@ g@@ ta@@ pe , and for that ex@@ ecu@@ tion , she had to do it for seven years at a har@@ sh labor camp .
now , that super@@ ficial story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we face in the next mil@@ len@@ nia .
he cla@@ ims stor@@ es on the sides of the grain of glass , and as it was completely fro@@ zen , he was star@@ t@@ ling a dog with him .
and that &apos;s something that people use it , and they use it , and the benefit to the user is always going to get bigger .
how if you take a web@@ search for images , where you put them in , and the text con@@ tains a lot of information that is a lot of information that is written .
the reason that this is is that freedom is good , meaning@@ ful , meaning@@ ful , meaning@@ ful , meaning@@ ful as@@ set for human .
in other aspe@@ cts of life , which are much more significant than that , the same explosion of choice is possible .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions separate whether that means all of the challenges that i &apos;m telling you , and no good grade in my course .
and he &apos;s sp@@ inning two weeks from the mind that he &apos;s been re@@ ference to , day about day , a great par@@ king lot .
because the truth is that if you break the gold glass glass so everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom ; you have paraly@@ sis .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before the human genome and what could mean , and the discovery of new groups of the genes .
here &apos;s an example of that . there &apos;s an organis@@ m called d@@ ein@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ c@@ c@@ us &apos;s three million ra@@ ins of radiation .
it may sound like genom@@ ic al@@ ch@@ im@@ a , but we can also change the software dna , things pretty dra@@ matically change .
and it &apos;s only just frag@@ mented . we can sel@@ ec@@ tively blood production and production production and so on .
but in fact , shor@@ ter is a little bit more strange in my life , and i &apos;ve come to work that made me think about this work completely directly .
i literally grew up in the fore@@ sts of british colum@@ bia , and i believed that these fore@@ sts are there to be lost .
i &apos;m saying it right now , because we are now all kind of like friends -- it &apos;s absolutely likely that my biggest success lies behind me .
and then there were these moments -- i &apos;m never going to forget -- she said that there was eye spec@@ im@@ ens in where they were ex@@ posed to it .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve seen all of them in your life .
ol@@ ol@@ Ã© ! s@@ hal@@ p for you , for sure , is that you have the m@@ ere human love and the sense of being there .
let me say , well , al gore , nan@@ cy p@@ el@@ o@@ s@@ i , har@@ ry ri@@ d , you know , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
and , there we go , yes , that &apos;s what we want , what do we want to say , what do we want to share with ?
these are the people who have been at least last capit@@ als on the website , d.@@ i@@ .@@ y@@ .@@ bio@@ bio@@ -@@ or@@ g website .
and that &apos;s a gigan@@ tic network of very good , yes , infra@@ struc@@ tural centers , all over the world .
that &apos;s a question that i &apos;m very moved to as design , but in the research of the research , and in the research lab , in the real@@ m of the entire world experience .
that means that this is a kid who has spent most of the time that the majority of his life has spent most of his life with the re@@ cep@@ tion of stories .
you also needed to learn , well , not a small child can talk about nature , but we are also learning it super@@ c@@ essi@@ ve and all of course .
so you have to engage in what does this mean , and not just change it , it should be better , but it should be better .
remark@@ ably , we &apos;ve been here with something that would be self-@@ confidence , but not that much .
even today , if you &apos;re in china , if you &apos;re in china , you expect to sta@@ ying the toi@@ let , until you &apos;re looking up the toi@@ let .
these notes are about the same as just as a verb@@ al , as well as a verb@@ al pen@@ ic@@ y , descri@@ ption a landscape .
one night , i went to a long time , and i thought , oh my goo@@ dness , if a ju@@ dge can change us in something else , then he must have magic force .
now , i &apos;ve got a new generation of programs that came from combin@@ ation of programs that are slightly closer to the conclu@@ sion than others .
in an interaction of the book , you put out on a look , you have to go out and collect the camera of the i@@ pa@@ ds of natural objects .
we all move us to a world where the forces of technology are closer to , and in the magic and technology , can be approach@@ ed .
we bring our kids closer and closer to the natural world , and the magic , and the love of our childhood , through the simple medium of a story .
one out of three males , between 18 and 30 , in real prison , in prison , right ?
but our system is not just mol@@ ded by asking the problems that have ra@@ ked with ra@@ il@@ di@@ ty , it &apos;s made by poverty .
in south africa , people understood that the ra@@ c@@ uses aren &apos;t over@@ come with the truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
down to lady car@@ r and then said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , wife par@@ ks comes into town . we want us to be entertain@@ ed .
you &apos;ve also seen tv &apos;s little evolution of evolution where it has shown a little evolution in the &quot; con@@ vol@@ um@@ o &quot; program in front of your eyes .
in my as@@ sign@@ ment , i expla@@ ined that mis@@ mis@@ sions of the citi@@ zen@@ ship , and the police and bu@@ g@@ ger .
in fact , the court was full of people who were mad , that we were talking about skin color languages , about poverty , about ine@@ quality .
he was talking to the family and i &apos;m sure that he was gl@@ ori@@ fied and safe that i was not laugh@@ ing .
you can have the goo@@ gl@@ s , but it &apos;s not an infe@@ ction of the ro@@ ch@@ ens , but the top res@@ pir@@ ation of the brea@@ ks , caus@@ ing the brea@@ ks of brea@@ ks .
and it points to other people , not just about making it , but in a roman@@ tic , suppor@@ tive way of all of all benefit .
fis@@ her@@ ance gener@@ alized countries that had 100 fish , the industrial fis@@ her@@ es of this kind of ug@@ ly ship called mu@@ ti@@ ar@@ a four .
the most part of the fish that little dots there on the tr@@ un@@ k , the tr@@ um@@ p , were coral re@@ ef@@ s fish .
like a ni@@ ght@@ light , or why the do@@ ors end up re@@ acting to the bottom , or how an ipo@@ d respon@@ ds to touch .
and what we learned was , the more f@@ on@@ ds have been embra@@ ced that , in fact , partic@@ le rate was lower .
imagine a heli@@ cop@@ ter , like the one you saw earlier , which is completely syn@@ chr@@ oni@@ ve .
so both , the physical cloud cloud in the sky , and something on the top , can go to the point of lon@@ d@@ ons of new mountain p@@ ills .
i feel the feeling i was car@@ ried under water , and finally , somebody moved down to the bottom , so i can brea@@ the up . &quot;
imagine a co@@ oper@@ a , a p@@ ale , sound , sound , sound , cla@@ speed , cla@@ speed , cla@@ speed , sound .
it turns out that there &apos;s a lab@@ el that didn &apos;t mo@@ se our che@@ ese -- s@@ mil@@ ing , but she didn &apos;t eat it .
so i said to my assi@@ stant , &quot; give me a list of every exper@@ ti@@ se of exper@@ ti@@ se and force plants out of our center . &quot;
any@@ ways , when i put myself on my path , and i keep going to see the medical record , they &apos;ll see biot@@ de@@ o@@ dor@@ ant .
that means that every at@@ om is at the same time at two different places , which is , the entire piece of metal in two places is the entire piece of metal in two places .
i have tissue that i wanted to be wearing everything else i would want to do when i first jum@@ ped to pal@@ m spr@@ ings .
none of these extreme decisions , ow@@ ning the choices that someone would re@@ com@@ men@@ d from people , if we care about their future financial well-@@ being .
and during that gather@@ ing , we have just as li@@ f@@ ting as they &apos;ve always been , so we &apos;ve ad@@ ded a little thing .
but the web video is allo@@ wing us all of our creative activi@@ ties that can be famous in a part of our world of our world in our world .
and if you &apos;re mad pl@@ ot@@ ting that , you know , you know , there &apos;s a three-@@ st@@ ill version that has been turned on four million times .
because being able to den@@ se the hori@@ zon , the hori@@ zon can mean that you embra@@ ce the assu@@ mp@@ tions of the environment .
there &apos;s a project right now in the california justice , which has paid two billion dollars so far , and it doesn &apos;t work .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , then we have a pretty good picture of how they did that .
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
you know , there are many challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concep@@ ts that we need to move forward .
the rema@@ ining 20 percent will be gener@@ ated in poor countries , and more agriculture is still going to be more agriculture , hopefully the wh@@ ale haw@@ king and c@@ ement to the end .
so to get these 8@@ 0s percent , the industri@@ alized states , including countries like china , are completely surro@@ unding their electricity .
that &apos;s what we need to do with full gas , and we can measure it , in corpo@@ rate numbers , and regu@@ lation change .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i asked my friends in the last time , and they asked everyone to go to the past .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed people , without the land that they live in .
we have the confidence in institutions , in auth@@ ority , and sometimes in science , there &apos;s no reason that it should not be .
if you put yourself on the path , where belief and magic are re@@ defin@@ ing science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
of course , it &apos;s being determin@@ ed there , but not through the magne@@ tis@@ m of my body , it &apos;s through my time finger , which is now there .
a p@@ ill twice a day is not as good as three p@@ ills -- i can &apos;t remember the same stati@@ stic . sorry .
i &apos;m not going to go into that . it &apos;s no longer pain@@ ful , but it was pain@@ ful when this study was done in 199@@ 0s .
and i &apos;ve probably come from my memor@@ ies in these three years , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
you can know how happy people live with their lives , and they really don &apos;t tell them much about how happy he lives lives and vice ver@@ sa .
we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ med . we feel en@@ danger@@ ed , and we feel thre@@ aten , perhaps depres@@ sed , fru@@ strated or cy@@ n@@ ologi@@ cally .
we trust that somebody &apos;s going to take time with us that the rules will be accep@@ ted , that we have the same goal , and to the end of the game .
this is the waste , which is 99 percent , and you &apos;ve got that part of it , so it &apos;s called the re@@ duc@@ i@@ ent ur@@ ani@@ ty .
of course , this was a great , old syn@@ ony@@ mous dic@@ tion@@ ary . i just thought that it must be quite ancient .
but the truth is , of course , we are facing the challenge , whether they are physi@@ cally , emotion@@ ally , or even both of them .
anthropo@@ pol@@ ar found that we have human beings from the members of our societies , to be useful and contribu@@ tion to contribu@@ te .
why don &apos;t we have the head@@ ability of a rat , especially if you can ex@@ tend it with the next generation of the bell machine ?
but because this individual is ab@@ sent the re@@ cep@@ tors to realize the re@@ acting , the bodies don &apos;t respond to the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
some people with x@@ x chromo@@ som@@ es , something which is called the o@@ Ã©@@ syn@@ thes@@ es , which is called the ei@@ va@@ ab tissue of ho@@ sted tis@@ su@@ es .
it seems like our culture seems to be a kind of pra@@ g@@ matic post@@ ure , &quot; well , we need to pull a line somewhere , so we &apos;ll pull them somewhere . &quot;
but it &apos;s also very bizar@@ re because of the history that i &apos;ve been talking to you about the re@@ cep@@ tor@@ al re@@ cep@@ tor@@ -@@ de@@ mis@@ e .
they can actually share it from the bottom , the most important moments for olymp@@ ics , and they share it as a way of conne@@ cting the community .
it starts with the gender , then the p@@ ale spo@@ tt@@ es come , and then finally , people do art .
in fact , we had to break in the par@@ king lot , so we felt comfortable as part of the descri@@ bing scene .
i was the one who &apos;s been in charge every week green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
and i called them up and they know her knowledge to compare her knowledge to what we found in the code and in the data .
so , for example , in a power station , if the big ste@@ ar@@ tur@@ ment is too quick , you &apos;ve got to open up in@@ struc@@ tors within milli@@ seconds of milli@@ seconds .
and i spent 30 days trying to eat nothing as a little bit of a difficult thing in the middle , a little difficult thing in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
and this is on a higher gra@@ ve of the user as the trans@@ mission of a classi@@ c metaphor , which is the des@@ k@@ top .
they &apos;re called the older brothers and they say that we are the yo@@ unger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
by the participa@@ tion , they don &apos;t give up to 5@@ 0,000 u.s. per year on labor emplo@@ yer , who would have been happy to ga@@ ther their contribu@@ tion .
dan gil@@ bert has made a big point today by telling a lot of the way we design things , depen@@ ding upon what we &apos;re compar@@ ing against .
and the more possibilities for choice , the more attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures of these choices are in the op@@ per@@ it@@ tan@@ ce cost .
and so i got what i expected , and i was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted to what i expected , and i was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted to what i expected .
so , if people make decisions , and even when the results are good , they feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted to themselves .
our ability to write genetic code is very slow , but the last point would now reduce an exponenti@@ al cur@@ ve .
i think the fact that it &apos;s hard to get the fact that we reach beyond our limit@@ s , the worth of things like the l@@ h@@ c .
from so@@ rates , it &apos;s known that he felt he would have a den@@ se that made him dist@@ antly dist@@ antly dist@@ antly divi@@ ded .
this is from the united states a network , which is actually a kind of a for@@ um , where you &apos;re going to hang yourself and talk online .
they &apos;re a little bit more technical and a little more business on the way , and then there &apos;s no such thing as it would be , so did you ask questions .
then their bra@@ in@@ waves were measu@@ red , and depen@@ ded on what they thought or how they thought about , are different lights on the room .
but at any rate , it &apos;s still not cheap now , but it &apos;s definitely available in a frame where it &apos;s really available .
and as we see things as we are looking forward , and as we sort of talk to ourselves about our environment , so we can think about that .
now , of course , the question is , what is the most intui@@ tive hand@@ ling circu@@ it of us humans and now i &apos;ve already gu@@ essed it .
and from those 6@@ 6@@ ,000 languages today , while we are in mon@@ ter@@ ey , they don &apos;t have half the e@@ ars of children .
i could also take ter@@ mit@@ es , but in the u.@@ s nobody li@@ kes ter@@ ror , as far as they &apos;re vege@@ t@@ arian .
and where you see , even in a matter like cei@@ meters , the stri@@ k@@ im@@ est bio@@ -@@ kil@@ ler -- yes is agriculture , it &apos;s allo@@ wing us to go back to our own me@@ tab@@ oli@@ cks .
so , the whole western civili@@ za@@ tion@@ -@@ story of civili@@ za@@ tional history is coming out that the city has only taken away , but the farmers never gave anything back .
very direct ad , and not for the fir@@ m of pu@@ ma per se , but for that they are now helping for this company to make products successful .
we can now do the things that they do when they break , if they fail , they can fly in biological cir@@ cles .
in the descri@@ ption of my speech , i said , as a sign , as an environ@@ ment@@ alist , as a transl@@ ator , i understand that in english , i understand .
there was a sch@@ ol@@ ar that was jo@@ han@@ nes bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ us and after this is named the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ an ari@@ el .
so just if you take another example , if you immediately take a ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack that makes a lot larger , then it doesn &apos;t take sensi@@ ble and anything to do it .
and the power@@ -@@ u@@ tili@@ ty , the power supply of power businesses on the island , has shared that we are doing great .
so here was a company that was trying to solve what was going to be the conc@@ ei@@ vable problem for our coo@@ ks . how do we keep fish on our own maps ?
now , he continu@@ es to tell me that it &apos;s such a wealth , the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
it &apos;s called pi@@ vo@@ t and what i can do with pi@@ le is that i can &apos;t filter a particular death cause .
you see , we sur@@ mp@@ ed the web as if it &apos;s really a web , not just from page , but much more abstra@@ ct .
but , if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s reduce the price -- let &apos;s hit the price -- let &apos;s hit a new bar@@ rier and that bar@@ rier depen@@ ds upon co2 combin@@ es .
who can do a little bit more than any other amount of waste that you can imagine from nuclear and other things ?
in fact , this mountain of mol@@ ars are harv@@ est@@ ed every time they drive in areas , which had never been destro@@ yed .
i literally grew up on the land , the old , rural south and i have a brother who is older and a year yo@@ unger sister .
and most of all , i want to look at young ones that are simil@@ arly just saying , lose your goal out of the eyes , don &apos;t give up . don &apos;t give up .
this is that the di@@ ets , electri@@ cally transpor@@ tation transpor@@ tation and communication costs are re@@ duc@@ ing a lot .
but then the technology was developed and made al@@ umin@@ um producing so cheap that we use it with our thro@@ wa@@ way ment@@ ality .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work on online to compe@@ te the new challenges , and to do what is needed .
and maybe i &apos;m in business for a long time that i could allow myself to give a piece of my own fal@@ se to do this .
lea@@ ther@@ hol@@ ds , like ted willi@@ ams -- the last major lea@@ gue of baseball of a regular seas@@ on shares over 400 times a regular seas@@ on .
and i went through those ei@@ gh@@ te@@ en , because they came to the st@@ unt care unit , and i hop@@ ed she would re@@ cover her .
then she said , &quot; well , next thing i &apos;m going to do is try to do the right thing , &quot; even if it dro@@ ps hard to do the right thing . &quot;
they will con@@ fir@@ m it because the evidence , as they were in a previous shape , they don &apos;t like the evidence they would like to post .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we don &apos;t live the sources of the past , because they don &apos;t live the sources of the past .
so my re@@ com@@ men@@ dation , the only one i &apos;m going to give , is going to turn to c@@ amer@@ on ii , so that he ro@@ tat@@ es &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar ii . &quot;
in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , in the commun@@ ist eastern eastern eastern country , you had to , if you put a writing writer , that was the government .
and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s likely to be sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ced , as a fra@@ gi@@ le , as a fra@@ gi@@ le in the real world .
rather than having progra@@ mm@@ ed , or they have to licen@@ se , allow li@@ tt@@ ing@@ ness to use them with simple , intui@@ tive gest@@ ures .
so to acceler@@ ate the blind or down , they just turn a butt@@ on , and it makes the moment@@ um faster or slo@@ wer .
so the idea is to show that brand is a part of the life , actually , to bring it to the film ?
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher are particularly important , but the words of a commit@@ ted teacher particularly signific@@ antly are meaning@@ ful .
for environmental crisis , a big problem , the last 10 years is that children are in their own in@@ struc@@ tors , their computers , without walking .
my current activity invol@@ ves objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design this in traditional sense .
so that &apos;s just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , if these dro@@ ps are getting a trick about abstra@@ ction .
but it wasn &apos;t about these oil recei@@ vers about living in today , because every single one of them was just a little , random reci@@ pe of chemicals .
we let us in foot@@ sc@@ ray c@@ est@@ ing , one of the work@@ places , whose population of im@@ migr@@ ants is consi@@ stent .
then the community formed by people who shared this large insi@@ le and started talking to them and playing around with them and playing around with them .
now it turns out that even if you were dis@@ gu@@ sting , even if more possibilities were the choices , even then it turns out , there &apos;s negative consequences .
in the places that nearly 60 f@@ on@@ ds occu@@ pi@@ ed , there &apos;s about the most se@@ tain@@ ing percentage .
from the people who are standing there when it were six , now we saw that 30 percent of you would buy a glass of mar@@ ker .
i have loved it to go to that business , but i asked myself , &quot; well , how do you do that you don &apos;t want to buy anything ?
but you could go to a completely new place , which is a completely new place block , and that &apos;s where the laws were going to be suppor@@ ted , and don &apos;t change it .
and the question is , &quot; did you do that to repli@@ cate a museum experience of a museum ? &quot;
they can look at everything with in@@ struc@@ tions , their friends , and they start a conversation about what they feel when they think of these ma@@ ster@@ pieces .
did you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use vision , because you know , how does this matter ?
about three or four years ago , i received a phone call from that teacher , her husband , who said , &quot; i have to see it .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe tomorrow &apos;s going to be somebody in la@@ gos , and it &apos;s just flying los angeles , right now , he &apos;s over o@@ hi@@ o .
that way , you can see that nei@@ ther at any time , there &apos;s no time for no time , as long as i can take a ride here , there &apos;s nothing in my sle@@ e@@ ve or come out .
and when i close my hand close , the same thing is going to be re@@ moved by this exercise , the fing@@ ers re@@ moved the finger .
why ? this picture is pretty much why i think games are so sick for survival of human species in the future . sever@@ e .
when i look at the next decade , i &apos;m sure about two things that we can create any imagination , and that we can play all sorts of games .
i call it ne@@ o-@@ evolution -- the new development isn &apos;t just natural , but we decided to be an individual in the choices that we do .
it &apos;s completely non-@@ invasi@@ ve sensor@@ s in the cru@@ t@@ ches , sending the signals back to the back of your back .
adap@@ t@@ ability technologies have been able to learn , again , to clim@@ b up , and even try to ride with the hands .
if i don &apos;t fighting the poverty , i &apos;m fighting as a fire@@ -@@ fire@@ man &apos;s designer at a mal@@ g@@ ger .
when i found the main man , he just had a very serious conversation in a very serious conversation , which has certainly been the worst days of their lives .
i &apos;m not saying that this is the answer to all human@@ it@@ arian problems -- because the life of the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s is more than the cam@@ a su@@ tra .
what i know is that it really seems important to think about the idea that the united states is the domin@@ ant , thinking about questions about democracy in democracy .
and since you don &apos;t have heard of me as the wife , the who &apos;s sitting here at ted -- is that i found a couple of things .
so the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you , show you a ice mountain that i &apos;ve been doing in ke@@ land in green@@ land .
and he said , &quot; no , just when you &apos;ve heard to the greater life layer and a remarkable pro@@ position , you can actually do that .
and , of course , there are teams like &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; -- and under the best time , there are fresh graduate students in kinder@@ garten .
we found one for them , and we took them , and we took care of her family , because it needed to be eight , because it was necessary .
and the re@@ stor@@ ed our attention , and we started a lab@@ el project , where we were using our environment with harmon@@ i@@ zed , and exam@@ ined this constru@@ cted .
and then we went to ti@@ ti@@ zing , and we tried with the real world in the world -- using potential goals in the real world .
what i want to do is , what i &apos;m going to do is show a film about in@@ c@@ ement , marketing and adverti@@ sing , with the entire film that &apos;s being fund@@ ed by free , marketing and adverti@@ sing .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s worth it , and i think it &apos;s worth a lot of life , some really famous brand .
i needed somebody who could come into my head , who could help me understand what you call &quot; brand person@@ ality . &quot;
because they went around the midd@@ le-@@ man , they were the ag@@ ents , and they said the ag@@ ents may not really have their interest in mind .
because if all the things are made out of the particles and all those particles follow the laws of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics , don &apos;t just follow all the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics ?
so if a single at@@ om can be at the same time at two different places , this piece of metal can be , why wouldn &apos;t it be you ?
i found out that about the same time , for about four years , hun@@ ting and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o was thinking about the challenge of re@@ form in hon@@ dur@@ as .
through impro@@ vement , you try and try through consumer , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of char@@ ter city to reduce the essen@@ ce of the world .
we give new technologies to change technology , but for progress , we need technology and laws , usually the laws that hold us back .
everything that you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get appro@@ ved .
so , what is it for an idea that every family has a choice between multiple cities that are in compe@@ tation to new in@@ habit@@ ants ?
now , in the last 10 years , we obser@@ ved three basic negative consequences that provide the offer of more and more choices invol@@ vement .
and not from these facili@@ ties , we &apos;ve got over hundreds of thousands of years in the last 20 years , none of these facili@@ ties have ever been ti@@ ed .
the can@@ adi@@ an government gave the in@@ u@@ it in apri@@ l in apri@@ l in apri@@ l , which is larger than california and texas .
we designed a wrong ad with very high resol@@ ution , which is much larger than a regular ad , and we have addi@@ tional content .
you can see that if we can create these kinds of vie@@ ws , where we can walk through images and make the experience of multi-@@ resol@@ ution .
if people have liber@@ ty , then all of us are for themselves to do the things that our shared ma@@ xic@@ on and nobody has to decide for us .
my favorite is in the middle -- mp@@ 3@@ -@@ play@@ ful , nas@@ ny ha@@ om , cr@@ Ã¨@@ me tom@@ ster l@@ Ã©@@ e tom@@ ley .
all proteins changed the mem@@ bran@@ es -- when we las@@ h the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve trans@@ fer@@ red .
they &apos;ve seen this year with the flu , we &apos;re always a year , and they have a dollar too little when it comes to the right vac@@ cin@@ es .
we are the light years of re@@ moved from human beings , and our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you very much .
i don &apos;t know if this was the greatest je@@ wer , or this , as someone else was vis@@ iting google page , and i found out the star@@ ter .
now , all of this is even more powerful when you think the magne@@ ts wei@@ gh@@ ted about 20 tons of in@@ ch and spread around about 30 in@@ ches .
but to be fair -- the groups of the chem@@ ist have not main@@ tain@@ ed the repu@@ tation of al@@ co@@ hol depres@@ sed people .
after some time of refle@@ ction seems to me that i have to make a way to create a kind of sense of mental psych@@ ological constru@@ ct .
the biggest factor for global warming , bes@@ i@@ des , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fu@@ els .
because , if you just read about it , from se@@ k@@ und@@ -@@ liter@@ ature , that &apos;s not the same as you do it yourself or you saw it .
because usually , through a new mode of use , the natural user is the natural cre@@ ature , for example , five times faster than our goal .
or if we go to the mountains of ti@@ bet , where i for@@ got a lot , you &apos;ll see the ug@@ ly face of political domin@@ ance .
but a li@@ f@@ ts@@ hi@@ p , even at this stage , i can tell you , is completely in@@ efficient , but most effective , yes ?
when i put them on the dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a to@@ oli@@ cl@@ oth with open taste and a glass of water .
but i had the big fortun@@ e to get him very early on , and so i went to his shoul@@ ses , and i went to his shoul@@ ses on his cour@@ ses .
it &apos;s necessary to have your own experience and the idea of music to bring it to another possibility , so over an instrument , to sound .
and you don &apos;t over@@ come the teacher , and you don &apos;t like to put a bri@@ ck somewhere and look forward , if the fire goes up .
and if you have these predic@@ tions , you can understand the analy@@ tics that we &apos;re trying to experience that happiness through the world is to improve our world .
and yes , a lot of what was told to me , i was very , very , very beautiful expres@@ sions that i &apos;ve been through .
this is going to be an energy supply , which then , the hydro@@ gen , me@@ than@@ e , power to gas , will know that it will be .
so we &apos;re not bat@@ ter@@ y-@@ maker , but we are re@@ defin@@ ing ourselves as a company , which is only between the theme of bat@@ tery , and everything is between .
and i just look at that in the next three years , the same capacity for electro@@ chemical memory in the world .
when steve lo@@ pe@@ z , the los angeles of los angeles , he went through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , is there a good bir@@ d@@ set of bird , which is not the last thing you want to have on a fish record ? &quot;
since then , in the 40 years , the in@@ mean@@ ings , i &apos;ve spent about 12@@ ,000 hours under under@@ water . 500 hours of it in exchange bo@@ ats .
in fact , if you could reduce the price , you could reduce the price of re@@ duc@@ ing the amount of energy in far more effective .
so let us look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 , which is em@@ it@@ ted by energy per unit .
because at that point an individual -- learning happened in the time of a single organis@@ m , rather than the evolution of a single organis@@ m , rather than that .
oh yeah , they go to a cock@@ tail party and there you might be hearing about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about your own er@@ ror .
and when it &apos;s good , and i &apos;m very hop@@ e@@ ful , then co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a will be using this technology worldwide in 20@@ 6 countries worldwide .
first of all , how much as she squ@@ ee@@ ze -- in good times , war or peace , re@@ c@@ ession , depression , food deli@@ ber@@ ation .
i go into the research prison and vis@@ ited a cli@@ ent who may be 13 or 14 years old , and as an adult , there should be an adult of dis@@ h .
then she was le@@ tting me car@@ ried a finger on my face and said , &quot; and therefore , you have to be very , very pa@@ sty . &quot;
it became very sil@@ ent , and then a woman said , &quot; well , with our history , it &apos;s impossible to kill us in the future of people .
i remember , i must have been eight or nine , which i wo@@ ke up in the morning , and all my cou@@ s@@ ins were wander@@ ing around .
i became large in a family , traditional afri@@ ro@@ american hou@@ se@@ hold , who was domin@@ ated by a twi@@ t@@ al in domin@@ ated , and this matri@@ ar@@ l was mine .
as pro@@ ctor and gam@@ ble re@@ turned the different head of head , they spent a rise of selling numbers about 10 percent .
some of these oil sp@@ ills invol@@ ved a particular combin@@ ation of chemicals that allowed them to integr@@ ate chemicals from ab@@ und@@ ance and grow them .
so let &apos;s go back , and that &apos;s 2.@@ 5 billion years , the earth was a large , ster@@ i@@ le stein@@ le with a lot of chemicals .
we &apos;ve been told to tell you that if it was about the regular chan@@ n@@ els , it would have taken over two years , and it would have cost over two million dollars .
and if you &apos;re in vac@@ ation and somebody else , your own rela@@ tives , or anyone else , can you find such an a@@ ed .
it &apos;s not very scientific , it &apos;s a c@@ up of coffee or te@@ a and te@@ a and ask the patient , families , rela@@ tives , &quot; how do we do it ?
what &apos;s important is that one person or group of ta@@ ste@@ makers invol@@ ved a stand@@ point , with a large audience and acceler@@ ated the process .
even even though the ge@@ ar ge@@ ar doesn &apos;t tell me about my pre@@ fer@@ ences , i &apos;m still creating it to sele@@ ct myself .
and a kind of digital glo@@ wer in the night -- but as the most important , a new kind of experience for everyone who wants to go to the top .
patient b clearly has a little bit more suff@@ ered , and his gut was longer , and every minute of pain , had patient had b , and more .
you probably look at this sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy , a fear , but also the ex@@ tent concent@@ ration of a really hard problem .
they can do more social bon@@ ds than they live in the real life , they get more feedback and reward in games than real life .
a human who has opened to me was my childhood physi@@ cian at a@@ .@@ d. , institute in wil@@ m@@ ing@@ ton institute in wil@@ der@@ ing@@ ton in dolph@@ in .
there are the usual one . it &apos;s not the usual . but they would really want to know that arms , gra@@ y person really wants to know if they exi@@ sted ?
in fact , you can say that the inevi@@ t@@ ability of the to@@ des will occu@@ r in the same moment , like sexual ferti@@ li@@ ty .
i think we would all be able to understand the mo@@ dd@@ le , and i think that they could understand all of this as he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to be im@@ mor@@ ted by my work .
it &apos;s not going to be a long time , until the reality is going to be the $ 1,000 human genom@@ es , and it &apos;s going to be more valuable for everyone .
it was the middle of the night , and it stood in a bat@@ ch , and bar@@ foot under a screen in the stream , while her house was in fl@@ ames .
a place where the women are leading the cep@@ ter with sex , &quot; in sex , &quot; and the game suggests that -- where a serious matter is a serious matter .
he has x chromo@@ some , and in wom@@ b , its side ax@@ es were so active that they &apos;ve created essentially a male hor@@ mon@@ ing .
and as con@@ sequence was su@@ mm@@ ed , his brain was the typical male part of the hor@@ son spectrum .
and if we are fac@@ ed with a body that actually represents something very different , con@@ tex@@ ted to these categ@@ ories .
mar@@ ia , he can &apos;t quite percei@@ ve the same pretty much in all states , which has the h@@ ein@@ rich in all states , and that &apos;s right too hot .
but before i show you what i &apos;m doing , i &apos;m going to make a very regular conf@@ ession , and that is : i &apos;m obs@@ essed with out@@ f@@ its .
there &apos;s a living self that lives in the pres@@ ence , and the present experience is capable of experi@@ en@@ cing the past , but basically just the pres@@ ence .
but we are not only going to be putting up the brand x as a ti@@ tle , but we &apos;ll be able to make sure that each possible categ@@ ory is selling in the movie .
in the course of the movie , we had more than 500 companies that were up and down , and the &quot; no &quot; said , &quot; no , because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
so i would feel a lot better than the whole thing , if we could somehow show that general objects also follow the laws of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
but you know what they were going to be in those places and their surro@@ unding areas and their surro@@ unding laws to avoid them from them .
in the next plan@@ tive elec@@ tive elec@@ tions , pe@@ pe lo@@ bo in a re@@ co@@ very whose plan to create new innova@@ tions , and den@@ se .
so i tried to per@@ su@@ ade the hon@@ dur@@ ans of that if you want to build a new city , you have to start with an area of at least 1,000 square kilometers .
this is a picture of a large , new city shel@@ ter that built in southern korea -- as much as the city of town .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read them and ask them to cla@@ p if they &apos;re willing to take care of them .
if you constantly use the de@@ fau@@ lt sele@@ ction in the decision , that means that they are over@@ wh@@ el@@ med , the hot@@ est , i &apos;m losing her .
what you &apos;re looking at is the people that go from the many people to the ger@@ m d@@ ele@@ ci@@ ums are going to go and vote the standard choice .
it also puts me into exc@@ it@@ ement about the big product that i put together , and so i &apos;m willing to make myself want to be interested with it .
so the things that look a little bit more reali@@ stic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things we don &apos;t think about in our lives .
these could be the bu@@ ri@@ cul@@ a , or techni@@ cian , for example , just to make sure that the comm@@ ands are still in his place .
now , for those of us who give rise to government , it &apos;s time we want to think about the world that we want to leave our children behind .
that could be a hy@@ dr@@ ants rele@@ ased , cr@@ as@@ hing , a mo@@ s@@ eller with a ben@@ ch .
imagine if for example , if you have your wife sad , if you &apos;ve been preg@@ nant , you get 15 ro@@ tten ro@@ ses .
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of work , and again , whether we should work or not work .
tri@@ ple@@ ts of this letter -- this letter en@@ ables about 20 amin@@ o aci@@ ds ; and there &apos;s a single compon@@ ent for each of these amin@@ o aci@@ ds .
if we &apos;d print it with a lot of a 10 and a half , it would deliver 14@@ 2 sides , just to print this genetic code .
for me , the best example of how you can do this can be the musi@@ cian tom wa@@ its . i took him a few years ago for a magazine .
but then he became older and quie@@ t . he told me that some@@ day he went to a quick@@ street in los angeles , and then changed everything for him .
so it &apos;s beginning to get this old epi@@ l@@ end@@ ment in the way i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to end up by this thing on forever .
compared to the whole scan of climate change in the atmosphere , this vie@@ wer could double when we cross the critical point .
the red dots , which all conne@@ cts them , is our depen@@ dence upon carbon dio@@ xide plants and foreign coal .
you can move your hand , you can percei@@ ve each other , you can percei@@ ve your mov@@ ements , and you have a screen and a func@@ tion@@ er .
and that is , yes , that &apos;s the most powerful guy , but the only thing that a matter of what a matter is , is this fascin@@ ation on the technology .
and this is bio@@ bio@@ space that just mentioned ha@@ cking space , which is , sort of , a vol@@ um@@ sho@@ ck school for molecular biology .
and the machines that are doing something like that , they &apos;re the most common one that you buy , the che@@ ap@@ est you go in about four thousand euro@@ s .
and if you want to make more in@@ formed citizens in the societies , and you want to be able to join a lot , you need the access to knowledge and to technology .
and ha@@ cking spaces , the computer ha@@ cker spaces , because the c@@ -@@ base was the first , nin@@ th hundreds of hundred people .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , put yourself in germany , in germany , all of the en@@ su@@ el@@ ation is in fr@@ yor@@ t .
now , there are now among us that i think that when i say , &quot; different possibilities of the s@@ being , &quot; really different possibilities of the s@@ halt mean .
if all the fing@@ ers , as well as it stands in the notes , it &apos;s going to be po@@ pping out of sound like music that sounds like music .
and you also know how much sti@@ gh@@ ty from that real ex@@ ception , the mirror cannot be lying out of this true out@@ come .
this re@@ ference suggests that in the heart of the bu@@ b , he &apos;s actually known that he &apos;s actually related to fire , but that he can &apos;t say that .
it &apos;s one of the preser@@ va@@ tions here , and i asked myself if i &apos;m going to give you a talk of wol@@ le and my ideas .
she &apos;s got a me@@ ga@@ wat@@ rus , and she can get six hours to get this effort , and that &apos;s the battery that we made in sort of simul@@ ating .
here &apos;s where we simu@@ late the entire trans@@ mit@@ ting system of the wir@@ es of the c@@ ables , to create the vi@@ bra@@ tional behavior in the grid , to create the vi@@ bra@@ tional behavior on the web .
and i realized that he wasn &apos;t just an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia of music , but she also had a close personal relationship with her too .
now , if i just want to get a larger over@@ all , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with bi@@ ke ? &quot;
that &apos;s important because you just look at web@@ sites in this kind of way , and that &apos;s how much of all the web can look at the same way .
and it worked . again , we created a ma@@ gical thing , and the impact in the audience was the same thing , but we &apos;ve done a little bit more money with the movie .
anyway , from the way that it has to do with curi@@ osity and science , it was everything . it was ad@@ vent@@ ure . it was imagination . it was imagination .
and i can say that now in a epidemic of fear , we &apos;ve never seen it , and hopefully i &apos;ll never see them again .
the data came from the u.@@ s , from the u.@@ s , from canada , and they were all the same , no cor@@ relation , no cor@@ relation , no cor@@ relation .
and in a few hours , he goes and he r@@ enting a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these amazing ted@@ dinner dinner ton@@ ight .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s certainly not so stupid and the skin , just to give us a few minutes . &quot;
we &apos;re going through the same st@@ ages , which are multi-@@ cell organisms -- the abstra@@ ction of our metho@@ d@@ ology , to work .
the process fe@@ eding itself and therefore , i believe , auto@@ -@@ cat@@ aly@@ tic is the word -- if something changes its change .
i sat together in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 with mar@@ v@@ in min@@ sky , and he says , &quot; oh look . look at this . look at it .
at the time , when the indian war@@ ri@@ or prin@@ ce took ar@@ med , he took a bo@@ w in the ground and water .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and said , &quot; do you feel more embra@@ ce ? &quot;
she took me outside , and she said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you &apos;ve got to talk to you that you don &apos;t tell them . &quot;
we believe that because you &apos;ve been able to tell us that the real question is : does a human being to die for a matter of rules ?
and then you change your pu@@ p@@ il@@ es , and you &apos;re in front of your head , then you look down , and start to tell your stories .
now , a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate , if you have a website with h@@ t@@ ps , for example , there &apos;s g@@ mail , for example , g@@ mail .
the first con@@ cre@@ te butt@@ blocks were made in 18@@ 6@@ 8 , and we came up with a simple idea : mo@@ du@@ le from c@@ ement , that would fit together .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab and i started studying this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hand by an artist and designer .
what if they could do the genetic change to elimin@@ ate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease , or elimin@@ ating the re@@ duc@@ tion of cancer ?
okay , so let &apos;s think about that . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , and that a farm that doesn &apos;t occu@@ r to their own lives .
the idea of the company was to ski@@ p up the phase of op@@ tical cu@@ es with op@@ tical prin@@ ting c. and start starting with digital products .
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of government docum@@ ents that give us data , and i understand that we all do .
and you know what ? if i say that , people are taking care of me and says , &quot; what car@@ es you ? let the people do what you want .
it &apos;s not about ri@@ ce kr@@ is@@ gun ; it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s much time to understand what that means .
and in that way , time is actually the critical vari@@ able that dist@@ ingu@@ ish@@ es a memory self from a common self , time has very little impact on this story .
now , when we cut out a few weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting thing that came out of this gall@@ up .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting investi@@ ga@@ tions that show people more , when we played through them , even when they &apos;ve played us .
we have a com@@ ic com@@ ic . we have &quot; level up &quot; for govern@@ ance , sustain@@ ability , sustain@@ ability , sustain@@ ability , sustain@@ ability , sustain@@ ability .
you have to separate two things : one health fact , to be am@@ am@@ it@@ ated and to the other mind , whether i &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ led or not .
the doctor &apos;s diagno@@ stic diagno@@ stic was my mother &apos;s vac@@ ation , and so my parents knew the husband who brought me to the world not .
they were just told them that these are the students , and they are the students with the class , and they &apos;re also teaching them to do something , and they &apos;re killing them .
this is not like human@@ lin ; this is the same protein that &apos;s made of chemicals that comes from the gut floor .
it &apos;s actually a light way for bacteria , with occasi@@ ons of un@@ inten@@ ded sub@@ mis@@ sions of un@@ inten@@ ded , du@@ o@@ v@@ ated .
i came to the reali@@ zation as a doctor that was a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not inevi@@ t@@ ably dis@@ mor@@ tal , just different .
no , i actually have mi@@ mic from this fish , because , i swi@@ t@@ ched to god , the fish of this conversation .
today , they can share a sequence of three bas@@ es of plants in the human genome of about 20@@ ,000 and a half of about a week of about a week .
the same technology that can produce the human insu@@ lin in bacteria that can &apos;t just make virus , but also to imm@@ une against other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experiment@@ al study in the cells of a vac@@ enz@@ a that has been built in the cells of a plant plant .
play invol@@ ves creativity and resili@@ ence , and it &apos;s all about gener@@ ating diversity -- variety to inter@@ actions , diversity of bio@@ diversity .
now , i don &apos;t want you to use a lot of time to imagine the production , because if you think of all the stuff , you &apos;re not going to listen to me all the time .
the green fa@@ thers came back and they brought back through a new an@@ atom@@ ic concept , and this concept said that all human beings were creating equal .
she ni@@ vel@@ li@@ zed the play@@ field and decided that an@@ atom@@ ically , the common@@ ali@@ ties count , not the differences . and that was very radical .
of course , the problem is , as we start to look at all those common@@ ali@@ ties , we start to question why we can susta@@ in certain separ@@ ators .
he says , we should not call people from their skin color , but after the property of their character , &quot; jud@@ g@@ ments of their character , &quot; and it goes beyond the autonom@@ y .
this whole out@@ fit , including the jac@@ ket has cost me 5@@ 5 , and it was the most expensive piece that i &apos;ve car@@ ried in this week week .
it &apos;s always been pro@@ mp@@ ted to me and over again when there was people walking around this week , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversation .
some time ago , it was that if you wanted to win a for@@ mul@@ a friend , then you took their budget and put it on a good driver , a good car .
there are many people sitting around the bit@@ ter end , whereas others don &apos;t make it more and more dra@@ matic , dra@@ matic passion .
and he was dre@@ aming for the first time his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a feeling that was on the park .
so , that really seemed my interest , and we started working on the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
so , it &apos;s just about explor@@ ing genes , to produce , to ga@@ ther around , to make it a frag@@ ment that you can make it visible .
and to give you a sense of that sen@@ sation , of course , i had to know something about this remarkable faith of the vo@@ wel@@ re , and don &apos;t know about vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is a cul@@ t of the black magic .
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different reali@@ ties , you can understand some of your extraordinary disco@@ ver@@ ies , like this plant plant here .
it &apos;s been cut in the age of two years at the age of two years to hi@@ de under your rock@@ 0s , because they couldn &apos;t live without it .
and at the end of us , we really want to be a choice in mon@@ ot@@ yp@@ ic world of the mon@@ ot@@ yp@@ e world living in a poly@@ chro@@ matic world of diversity ?
and even though the answer to the question , &quot; no , is definitely going to be the experience of the foot@@ ball game of your childhood pre@@ pre@@ e very differently than it would be .
because it &apos;s about 50 invest@@ ment@@ on@@ ds that are available to choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide how you should choose to wake up tomorrow .
op@@ per@@ tun@@ it@@ tan@@ ce costs the satis@@ fac@@ tion we get through our sele@@ ction also , although what we &apos;ve been looking for is amazing .
so to buy new je@@ ans , for many years of the vehicle , i said , &quot; i would love a few je@@ ans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
in fact , we &apos;ve been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed by 20 years than we &apos;ve been looking at human genome , the shif@@ ts of the world to the digital world of the computer to the digital world of the computer .
that &apos;s brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psych@@ ological constru@@ ct that are prote@@ cting you from the consequences of your work .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be full of p@@ ones , if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspe@@ cts of your existence have come from them .
so as you can see , my desire is to develop new human@@ -@@ computer interface , the way our brains and bodies work .
that &apos;s kind of sa@@ d@@ ding the ha@@ cker scene , because that &apos;s not what they actually thought about , which is exactly what she actually started doing , and actually behind it .
and that is , the software ha@@ cker , in the 197@@ 0s , starting with computer ba@@ ths , and it &apos;s also made the internet .
and from those networks , the entire most popular thing that i want you to do is create a scene that i want to show you a little bit about portra@@ it .
they have a strange language , and a pro@@ per capit@@ um called the l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic ex@@ og@@ am@@ ment : you have to mar@@ ry someone to talk to another language .
because , as the beginning said , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have pretty little idea about it , too .
and we hope , of course , we &apos;re going to spread ourselves , and then simil@@ arly simil@@ arly connected , so much as money can be involved with people .
it &apos;s not so simple now , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curious curi@@ osity and enough energy , you get too far .
and that wealth that has virtual reality , which people have had in the pre-@@ industrial times , because they had nothing to do in the pre-@@ industrial times .
and as you see , this is a very in@@ tra@@ cted area , and you had to navi@@ gate to , island to island , to get food .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we &apos;ve shif@@ ted responsibility for our own memor@@ ies , and the production of our individual memor@@ ies .
now , you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why are all the ages on the age of , ar@@ a@@ stic vac@@ ations of communic@@ ations and so on and so on .
so if we look at the evolution of our societies , here &apos;s a brief story now , let &apos;s move from the third into the fourth world or social form .
depen@@ ding upon me , as i say , and when i &apos;m gh@@ ted , it &apos;s a very different repor@@ tion of course than if there is a living kind of a living kind of life .
that means , from the local village , it has become a global village with the same principles , of course , of course , innovative , but the total transpar@@ ency .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , it &apos;s the highest , not being there ?
so , it &apos;s not enough to read notes , to read it , and put that on the piano on the piano , or to put the right spot on a vi@@ o@@ lin .
after you start to play a tun@@ e , because you get excited to play the research , you start re@@ com@@ position the re@@ com@@ position of the com@@ position for the re@@ com@@ position .
there &apos;s a sch@@ ol@@ ar , the name of wol@@ f sing@@ ers , and he says , &quot; well , sometimes it &apos;s a will@@ ing@@ ness . &quot;
and the place of terror@@ ic muscle , and that was that it was called the vi@@ br@@ om@@ on@@ ics and all of the sun , and i started the middle of the sun .
i combin@@ ed it with my former pre@@ ci@@ pit@@ ation , but it was a little bit different , because the camera was a lot of the way in the planning .
and she works in a medical culture that recogni@@ zes that people fill the system with life , and if that &apos;s like that , people can make mistakes too .
and then on a given day , there was a hole in the clou@@ ds and the sun broke me , and i could feel better even better .
remember , a ma@@ ko@@ i war@@ ri@@ or in the middle of kenya has a better mobile communic@@ ator than president re@@ ag@@ an 25 years ago .
and because we have nothing more important than our survival , the first phase for all the information is a part of our tem@@ po@@ ral la@@ gl@@ ing , the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala .
i know and i &apos;m sure they do the job , because they come from a series of thousands of thousands of programs that have done the job .
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of government fundament@@ als in a way that actually can achieve a lot of people .
and you could be able to com@@ bine them with government services if they were needed , but a neighb@@ or is a far better and che@@ aper way to nur@@ se services .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all do@@ do@@ do@@ s in your house and play a lot of music , and see if that &apos;s the c@@ and@@ le off ? &quot;
and it will allow people to measure from home from home , sending it to their doctor and share it with others , for more than 100 dollars .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can really capture , but i want to leave it always as if it could have been on a photograph .
and you don &apos;t have to -- when the he@@ arts -- you don &apos;t have to take advantage of the user -- you don &apos;t have to put it on an us@@ p key , as we &apos;ve seen it at graduate .
in the other hand , i was in un@@ sec@@ ure life , the tra@@ gic nar@@ sc@@ ure of violence , of the drug ab@@ use of the drug .
in other words , unlike the fin@@ ance class , whose existence was completely known as well , there was no sophisti@@ cated thinking .
think about the dis@@ count of the dis@@ connect in sa@@ ig@@ on &apos;s eyes , as he has got to get his life a single war@@ ning .
in a world , in every minute 2 days of video , it can only get unique and un@@ expected out@@ come as the mentioned of video .
and g@@ ary said that he would be willing to provide all of the people in this audience to provide an in@@ wise vac@@ ation of the world in the world .
they had over 75 different var@@ ie@@ ties of o@@ live oil , including the ones that were lin@@ ked in bo@@ xes , by thousands of years of o@@ live trees .
when we were he@@ cking up the lights and looked inside the box , we saw that this piece was all over there in a piece .
so the first case : all the trilli@@ ons of nuclear that are caus@@ ing a piece of metal that &apos;s going to be bene@@ ficial , and at the same time , same nuclear atoms go up and down .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see this piece of metal mechan@@ ical , we &apos;ve had to get rid of all the p@@ ills out of it .
the incredible thing for me is that projects i had spent most of the feedback , and where i had the greatest success , those are where i interact with things directly .
so i decided one day i went to visit the la@@ sts , and i asked the head , &quot; works this model that they really are doing all of these possibilities ? &quot;
but they also have a secret for our future , a future in which we have to ada@@ pt to more common challenges , by far creativity and prin@@ ch co@@ operation .
what they re@@ turned was a autonom@@ ous concept , and they brought it down through a different , radi@@ cally and beautiful , and 200 years of doing that .
many of our friends thought that we are beautiful stupid , and that we would get back to the walls , and all of the images on the walls were gra@@ ff@@ iti wei@@ gh@@ ted .
and after a year of the plan , two weeks of progra@@ mming , &quot; a zer@@ tor@@ i@@ ty , &quot; came through for the first time , tony went back to seven years .
and as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult , she turned into a box , she turned into a box , and was put in my hands .
i sent some facebook mes@@ sages , some twitter mes@@ sages , and i gave people the opportunity to get the nam@@ i@@ ties on my ted@@ talk .
and then my friends say , &quot; well , how do we do with these big , gigan@@ tic hollywood movies compe@@ te ? &quot;
now , there was con@@ ci@@ p@@ ated brand and eight mar@@ g@@ ands , these things that come and go , but a leader , ei@@ ght-@@ effective brand is a pretty strong thing .
l@@ oud bur@@ r@@ elle was the pre@@ de@@ er in janu@@ ary , and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there &apos;s 9@@ 00 million million calls of this film .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project , which is almost every ad that we were talking about , their cli@@ ents have re@@ com@@ men@@ ded .
i mean , it can sound like a thing that is a thing at the same time at two different places , but it wasn &apos;t born with this idea , they developed her .
the head of con@@ gress came to the stage and said , &quot; professor ro@@ mer , i thank you very much for your ted@@ talk , but maybe we &apos;ll look at the ted@@ talk .
in a country that &apos;s just a he@@ art@@ ball crisis , in con@@ gress , con@@ gress were ele@@ cted by 1@@ 24 to a voice .
a country has already been provi@@ ded to provide the highest court court as a dis@@ h for the design system of the village system .
when i was a graduate student at stanford , i went to this very ex@@ clu@@ sive life store , at least he was ex@@ clu@@ sive .
we &apos;re going to have a process that is usually dem@@ and@@ ing 100,000 years , and we can com@@ press it for thousands of years , and maybe even on the next 100 years .
personally , i personally fin@@ ance that it &apos;s a place to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to deal with the ideas in its mind .
one day -- that &apos;s an actual report -- it came into this : &quot; th@@ yl@@ ac@@ te in my tr@@ ash ton@@ ne can &apos;t tell if she &apos;s dead . &quot;
but this app@@ s are like little digital memor@@ ies that we are not only consum@@ ers , and we don &apos;t just consu@@ me government that contro@@ ls control and services .
so an organis@@ m could learn to eat a particular fru@@ it , not because she was sick and she got sick , the last time he ate her .
there , &quot; this plane is made out of hundreds of thousands of small@@ parts that work together to make yourself more sec@@ ure . &quot;
i spend most of my time with social spon@@ sor@@ s in the social town and in places that are much hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ly hop@@ ky .
in nine people that we &apos;ve been ex@@ pos@@ ure , one that we &apos;ve been doing for inno@@ cent , which has been dis@@ rup@@ ted and made out of death row .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up on my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s too dist@@ antly dist@@ ur@@ bed , you &apos;re talking to hear . &quot;
finally , this older guy came in with a very concerned fac@@ ial in the court room , and i sat down to the defen@@ se bank , almost on the defen@@ se bank .
if i think about creating ab@@ und@@ ance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of lux@@ ury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of choices .
remember , as a car@@ l sa@@ gan , the vo@@ y@@ a@@ ger@@ -@@ spac@@ el , 199@@ 0 , back to the earth ?
now , imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of our contribu@@ tors and 1.@@ 3 percent of the staf@@ f of healthcare .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst failure only was passi@@ ve in the first five years , which many of my colleagues cla@@ im@@ ed , but it &apos;s total gri@@ m .
now , in eg@@ y@@ pt , in the apri@@ l of apri@@ l , in apri@@ l of 2008 , the average scri@@ pt of the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an police police , and they found a lot of actions .
we want the world to create the inv@@ ent@@ or , the inv@@ ent@@ or , who encoura@@ gues the encoura@@ gement , because this world , in the world we live in life , are us .
but the measu@@ re@@ ment cr@@ ank very clearly , and people in my company told me that we shouldn &apos;t be able to do that .
in fact , let &apos;s start from a new point : we are di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed by the digital code in a new phase of biology , using new life and building them .
and the job is to create the conditions that exi@@ sted less than a billi@@ on@@ ai@@ re second to start in the beginning of the universe -- and to 600 million times in a second .
we &apos;re going to turn it on , and expect first data in jun@@ e or j@@ ul@@ i colle@@ cting our journey to try to figure out what the building blocks are in the universe .
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t see everything for yourself , everybody knew you had this non@@ verb@@ al geni@@ us that helped you have helped that .
and that &apos;s not what we then do , but that &apos;s actually what i think is a relatively common thing that people are doing right now .
a seas@@ on , if you make the full power with water , you have enough pressure , so i guess that there are four to six thousand to six thousand to six thousand .
it &apos;s how you get to experience people in inter@@ active media so that they can use these inter@@ active media , and make them a good satis@@ fying experience .
that means that we &apos;re going to take pro@@ s@@ ie@@ ction before we see it coming back in our he@@ he@@ x , to put it in our he@@ he@@ x , to say , okay .
and it &apos;s a l@@ ust , as you see in it@@ al@@ y , like the people in the high bo@@ w pon@@ ds out of the car .
it &apos;s always a happy conc@@ ert when i have the experience that i may have been working for as long as i &apos;ve ever been working .
i was then 17 years ago , when i was playing on one of his cour@@ ses , and played the last bar from the four bal@@ la@@ ds of ch@@ op@@ in , a late work .
but the analy@@ tics of de@@ ception allow us to pre@@ tend the first sentence of the cur@@ ve is wrong as a result of evidence of evidence .
and now you can just , if you want to do anything yourself , if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , the coura@@ ge to change the coura@@ ge .
yeah , that &apos;s a huge debate at the moment , building co@@ al-@@ force , because we don &apos;t know , or ga@@ stur@@ bin@@ es because it doesn &apos;t go .
and a lot of argu@@ ments i had in the last six years have been similar to the discussion that i &apos;ve had in the last year , which i &apos;ve had over the last 30 years now , was photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic .
the reason i felt worse was with all those available choices , my expec@@ tations for what a good pair of je@@ ans did , went up .
because we did all this with only 10 to 12 people who have been working for years , sometimes we had two to three months ago , sometimes we were back to sea to three months or three months ago .
so , i stood back with a little team on un@@ known ter@@ rain . we looked at &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; with a new technology that wasn &apos;t there before .
but if you have a very cheap fuel , you can do it for 60 years -- think about a p@@ ill@@ ar that you bu@@ ried out of it .
so , that &apos;s what the re@@ ac@@ tors have been , which is what we put in our po@@ und , and that &apos;s where the g@@ arb@@ age volu@@ me is dra@@ matically redu@@ cted in this process .
there &apos;s a series of people who have much more &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh &quot; moments than others , and under the worst , they are fresh b@@ w@@ l absolute reti@@ d .
and sometimes a little prototyp@@ e of this experience is anything that it takes to bring us from a &quot; u@@ h &quot; moment .
but that &apos;s what kee@@ ps me at night -- one of the things that hold me at night -- we &apos;ve never needed science so much as now , never before .
and i was star@@ t@@ led to reve@@ al resi@@ stance towards what was the most effective measure in health care in the history of human history .
we have to run these conver@@ sa@@ tions , and we need to think , but if we go to the time machine , we &apos;re going to be able to do that .
i said , &quot; well , i close my wr@@ ist , &quot; to make sure that nothing in my mind hat@@ ches that there &apos;s nothing like that , and that &apos;s a gap .
how to get lucky can dep@@ end on the way you think and whether you think of yourself thinking about yourself or whether you think of yourself thinking about yourself or whether you think of it yourself .
but the lat@@ est of dna evidence show that the e@@ tr@@ us@@ ers that come along the ro@@ man em@@ pi@@ re is the same thing as the old ly@@ di@@ er .
and maybe we &apos;ll be able to see , wi@@ dri@@ ties than something natural and useful and useful , and feel like that through their pres@@ ence not so much .
it seems like though we &apos;re right from the other parts of the building of life , but actually the most fundamental part , the fundamental mechanis@@ ms are pretty much the same .
so we &apos;re not just responsible to keep people living in front of fa@@ sal@@ es , but they also pre@@ fer to main@@ tain good job .
that &apos;s what we needed to do at the time . if children were las@@ ering a book , we took the descri@@ ption of the au@@ tor and sig@@ ned them into the can@@ v@@ as in our heads .
and something interesting happened . what happened to me was that jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ le was really intri@@ gu@@ ed in the world , was completely un@@ known world on earth .
the movie studio , i was selling this as &quot; ro@@ me@@ o and juli@@ a on a ship . &quot; it became a love film , a passionate film .
the other grade is , if we use the zer@@ o-@@ emis@@ sion of technology , whether it &apos;s used in all the developed world , and we are on the way to get to the rest .
b@@ g : well , we need one of these sc@@ ali@@ able things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to build , and then 20 years to use .
b@@ g : well , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s spend 10 billion per year more than you today -- that &apos;s not dra@@ matic .
now , what i &apos;m saying is , too many chemicals , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des , hor@@ mon@@ ci@@ des , mon@@ o@@ culture , we don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing that is wrong .
they don &apos;t count because he was connected to memory ; the memory was ru@@ ined , and the memory was everything he had to keep in mind .
what that means is , if you were going to meet somebody , you would tell them , oh , his father is a two-@@ meter man , how much would you know about the size ?
when i tell them that somebody has been doing his life at eight feet , they have a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy it is about how happy it is .
and what &apos;s happened is , if you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and others , and that differ@@ enti@@ ation is , let &apos;s say , in the climate .
if you also play , you see a few nu@@ an@@ ces that go up in the upp@@ er eyes and your mou@@ ths are a sign of optimis@@ m .
but also . because it turns out that by using all this time , we actually use the whole thing to change as human beings in the world .
so they invented , according to her@@ od@@ he@@ us , the cu@@ roll and the com@@ posed was a national strategy , on a day , you would be eating . next day you would play .
and imagine , i &apos;ve even tried a five-@@ year-old child with dr. p@@ . and so on , so that these appli@@ cations begin to stop , natural sele@@ ctions are not succe@@ e@@ ded .
and because it nei@@ ther video games with computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated fil@@ es , we had the whole ima@@ gery in the media , i had to create the images in my head .
and it &apos;s that play@@ ful curious that let us do that , and interact , and the un@@ expected link to creativity that we create , are real nutri@@ tion of creativity .
and i &apos;ve been working with inter@@ sexual people who are their gender at@@ yp@@ ical -- so people that don &apos;t occu@@ r the average males or female bodies .
a lot of journ@@ alists , he called me , &quot; how do you want to do that , whether ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya is female or male ? &quot;
one of the areas that we see to the contribu@@ tion of our culture today , in the united states today , are the f@@ at@@ u@@ at@@ ess of the beginning , the end of the end of life .
if we look at one of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers of modern democracy , dr. lu@@ ther king , he gives us a dream , &quot; i &apos;ve got a dream , &quot; a solution to it .
i love being able to do a different kind of far@@ d-@@ fro@@ zen , crazy out@@ fit , to wear , and to photograph it last time , and to photograph it .
and finally , satur@@ day , a unique unique style , is a great way to tell the world something about a word .
my wife , my children and i are in the garage , and these ha@@ ck@@ ers and progra@@ mm@@ ers and progra@@ mm@@ ers have adop@@ ted our house .
and if you &apos;ve already come to the fact that the drug of the ti@@ pp@@ net is complex and high-@@ tech , let me tell you the data is science for itself .
are you reli@@ able , stable , family , sec@@ ure , sac@@ red , sac@@ red , and the way the d@@ al@@ ai lam@@ a or yo@@ da ?
and i look at myself as one of the people together , with most other clinical quant@@ um physi@@ ci@@ sts that need a good fra@@ ction of the complex ideas together to bring together the complex ideas together .
and it turns out that if you make it , it &apos;s a very good tool , so you can get people to save more .
simil@@ arly , unlike the dis@@ si@@ se entertain@@ ment of the 20th century , the part of the community will be part of this phenomenon , either by spre@@ ading it or something new from it .
i got a je@@ je@@ c@@ table , because i went to the bi@@ ke , but often there &apos;s dis@@ ability that doesn &apos;t let it go on the free@@ zon .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed a couple of months to get them to get different places to the pieces of the puzz@@ le .
and if we succe@@ e@@ ded , of course , we succe@@ e@@ ded , for ni@@ ke , and the whole tex@@ ting industry with me and the whole tex@@ ting industry .
the reason that it was better than anything that was worse than anything was worse , it was possible for people to do experiences that were a pleas@@ ant surprise .
in each turn , we have made these pieces of the over@@ s@@ w@@ ells , so we could actually sequence them , because we tried to build a very ra@@ sted process in what you &apos;ll see in a minute .
and i &apos;ve been argu@@ ing that we might be able to create a new form of cham@@ br@@ any explosion based on this digital design .
now we have , from our disco@@ ver@@ ies around the world , a data dat@@ ab@@ ase , and i want to believe that this is the design compon@@ ent of the future .
so , it &apos;s so far . and for everyone that wasn &apos;t there , the l@@ h@@ c is the largest scientific experiment that has ever arrived -- 27 kilometers in diam@@ e@@ ter .
because it makes sense as much meaning as anything that i &apos;ve heard about when it left , which is completely fre@@ ak@@ y fre@@ ak@@ y to explain the creative process of creativity .
a process that goes -- like everyone who has ever tried to make something -- in other words , everyone here -- not always sensi@@ ble .
i &apos;m a wall animal , and i have to be able to stand up at the same time , and swe@@ at me , and really dis@@ comfortable , and really dis@@ comfortable .
i said , &quot; look , you know , you and i know both , if this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fau@@ lt , right ?
basically , you &apos;ll get a sp@@ ell on every si@@ de@@ at@@ able letter , and as you try to make words , you &apos;re going to be te@@ sted on a dic@@ tion@@ ary .
i think the molecular biology in general now is very common@@ ly speaking , biot@@ echn@@ ology , everything you count about , syn@@ thetic biology , and so on .
and we &apos;re really ti@@ ring to the media cam@@ pus for the virtual reality in our v@@ .@@ r@@ .@@ r@@ .@@ r lab , so we can actually do the whole thing .
as you knew in the village , who was doing what , and when this exten@@ sion is happening today on our own tra@@ de-@@ off@@ s of our self through a global scale .
and it &apos;s intui@@ tive of users not only for apple to do a fundamental economic economic factor , so far as i want to make a technologi@@ cal tool in the world .
they have to imagine that if they do something about the classi@@ c tra@@ pp@@ er , five hours , and with this new type of natural software , only one hour of the natural software was just one hour .
this is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , the many of you have heard the stron@@ gest psycho@@ active pre@@ per@@ e from the re@@ per@@ toi@@ re of sh@@ ame .
from the ger@@ man into english , more knowledge can predict , even if you go to den@@ poetry or poetry about poetry .
that means that the interpre@@ ter needs to be not@@ ed in a different one , nam@@ able , non-@@ verb@@ al , non@@ verb@@ al music language .
now , i can tell you today the sound that the stream has had on the modern grand piano , which is a b@@ aro@@ ky c@@ empathy that doesn &apos;t do it .
at this point , when you &apos;re laugh@@ ing , you see how important this gap is , and how much time you need to know what artists can tell us .
i &apos;ve told my wife , every time a human in a moral legal proce@@ d@@ ure , the words should be used to re@@ plac@@ ement , we should try to replace it by being able to replace it by the words .
no , it just looks much better when we show that we are hop@@ ing to make the dan@@ gers , the other one first , when you put fire in fire .
and so we decided to build a pair in ber@@ lin , in which way in which we can train the electric propor@@ tion of the island at three to three .
and our european net is basically just a l@@ oud ro@@ tat@@ ing mass of large power , wher@@ ever the wave goes around europe all over the place .
so far in argu@@ ments we &apos;ve been trying to do that , this insu@@ lan@@ ters , they do a little small net , which has nothing to do with our connection .
we came up with music , and a few days later , i got an email in the fact that na@@ than@@ iel was interested in the fact that na@@ than@@ iel was interested in me .
90 percent of the big fish , whom we love , the tun@@ as , the he@@ art@@ bu@@ le , the s@@ mon , they are collap@@ sed .
now , i had tele@@ phones with a few people in the company , no one could give me an extraordinary response to the bi@@ ologists , until finally with the li@@ f@@ ting bi@@ ologists .
she star@@ ds out on the hori@@ zon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see are cur@@ als , and that den@@ sity , li@@ f@@ ting mar@@ ch .
we can take a step further out , and we see the data then and see that cir@@ cul@@ atory diseases and cancer are the usual sus@@ pi@@ cious sus@@ pi@@ ci@@ on , but not for everyone .
jac@@ ks cou@@ ste@@ au came into our living room with his fascinating mu@@ d , which animals and places that we could never have imag@@ ined before .
but it could also be used to get people from their bac@@ ks , and they get them to play some kind of play to control their health .
so an ap@@ p that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s a sort of a s@@ w@@ ells of the bu@@ g on the institution of government .
and because the government finally gradu@@ ated their strength out of us -- remember , &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , it &apos;s going to change how this change is happening .
but then another , very interesting step , when things were completely different , they started communic@@ ating these cells and communic@@ ating information , so communities came from cells .
so , we take a very complicated , conver@@ t it into sound , a sequence of sound , and producing something very complicated in the heads of others .
as it turned out to live in a world where the ger@@ man state people made people , especially when there was a lot of je@@ ws , especially when there were many je@@ ws .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i believe that many of you understood the moral pen@@ dul@@ a , but that it &apos;s caus@@ ing the justice of the universe .
so these are just some of the cli@@ ps that i &apos;ve been colle@@ cting over the last six months -- it could be the last six days , or the last six years .
in the last 100 years , the average life expec@@ tan@@ ce has more than dou@@ bled in the trans@@ lation of the world &apos;s population has tri@@ pl@@ ed .
and every year we ask the students to create business , products and services that are posi@@ tively living in the decade of mil@@ lar@@ ds of people .
how about that , the supp@@ res@@ repres@@ sed , wher@@ ever you are , to make a voice to make yourself a voice and make change , for the first time ?
ladies and gentle@@ men , what interests me about is the fact that we have more power today than individuals to put ourselves the big challenges of our planet .
let &apos;s go back to the world of medicine , in which i feel a lot of well-@@ being , or maybe a little bit less likely i &apos;ve talked to you about .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable to take responsibility , and so i would be able to care for my patient without knowing it .
and i looked up with me that if i dou@@ bled my own eff@@ or@@ ts and never put a mistake back to the perfe@@ ction , that the voice could hit the voice .
and when you manipu@@ late the speed of this ro@@ tor , then you actually put the ro@@ tor up , and eventually , the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge explo@@ ds .
and from my perspective , the scientific method is to try and see if it works , if it doesn &apos;t work , the most great achie@@ vement of humanity .
now , that &apos;s good , except paul walking around and talked about vac@@ cin@@ es and says , &quot; how valuable they are , and people should just stop jam@@ ming . &quot;
but i think in this frame here , with the inten@@ tion of a real de@@ mis@@ e , i &apos;m just going to leave the need@@ le right there , and so on the stage .
the second chap@@ ter is a re@@ con@@ ci@@ le of experience and memory -- basically it &apos;s between happiness in his life , or happy with his life , or happy with his life , or happy with his life .
it &apos;s the living self , which is the doctor who car@@ es the doctor -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; do it now wake up when i put it down here ? &quot;
these are two very different un@@ its , living self and memory , and the two is part of the way through happiness of happiness .
if people would take that evidence , i mean , it all appe@@ ars to put everything on the head , everything that we believe in ta@@ x politics and so on .
and if you are with the working gre@@ ek histor@@ ian histor@@ ian , you may know this story , the history of how and why games were invented .
well , i hope that they are human resources that we can use to work in the real life , and that games are very important for change .
and by the way , we go and measure them so much that they can no longer say that isol@@ ation is necessary for evolution .
and so far as the isol@@ ation is , as a species , it will be o@@ ven and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
and a few weeks later , the fire@@ s@@ her@@ s received a letter of home@@ ow@@ ners in which they are working for the da@@ y@@ time on their house .
so gender is really complicated ; it &apos;s not only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some sense , you can spread over the entire range .
i think that the most remarkable thing that &apos;s happened in the last few years is that we &apos;ve shif@@ ted from a physics into a digital world .
but for over two weeks , we &apos;ve been progra@@ mm@@ ed progra@@ mming , we went to ven@@ ice , my children were brought up , and we created this .
they should have made these innova@@ tions and they would be sho@@ ot@@ ed by ridi@@ cul@@ ous circum@@ stances that are going to be made for this innovation .
and i was conf@@ used , because i thought the whole concept of adverti@@ sing is to introdu@@ ce your product as many people as possible to publi@@ sh it as much as possible .
so when i started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell them , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
but it was a fairly abstra@@ ct discussion on a spot when there was a break , oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the ted@@ talk . &quot;
i recently made a po@@ ll about 2,000 american people , and the average number of decisions that &apos;s made a typical americans in a day is 70 .
and these scientists have just docum@@ ented the different issues that these ce@@ o work on , and how much time they spent decisions together with the top@@ ics .
now , if they were doing it , they bought six times a glass of mar@@ ker , who you had six years ago , when they had 24 to choice .
my first memor@@ ies are by this boat -- the ste@@ ck@@ ens of the mot@@ or , the cla@@ pping of the terror@@ ism , the cla@@ pping of any wave on the bu@@ g , the va@@ se and empty horizon@@ tor .
and there &apos;s a generation that has grown up with the internet , and the idea is that it &apos;s not hard to do things together , you have to do it right .
now , all of these rand@@ om@@ -@@ to-@@ hand makers are in@@ struc@@ tions , all of the programs , and then finally finally choo@@ sing the ones who are on the next one . &quot;
of course , the chance of rand@@ om@@ ly rand@@ ged in@@ struc@@ tions is very small that they don &apos;t make a string of numbers , so they don &apos;t actually have to do this .
we are re@@ duc@@ ing that in 10 years , the quot@@ ation of the ci@@ vi@@ c dis@@ order of the ci@@ vi@@ c rights will be so high rights as the vot@@ ing of the ele@@ ction of vot@@ es .
when this device was a p@@ na@@ p or a dna virus that doesn &apos;t know it , it calls the health care , and it pre@@ v@@ ents a pan@@ de@@ mic on her cr@@ y@@ age .
what do you believe in the average power for a car@@ di@@ ologists or a nur@@ se or an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c , a birthday wor@@ ker ?
so that i sent them home , i made a quie@@ t voice in me who tried to tell me , &quot; oh man , no good idea . do not . &quot;
so if you take the system , as i &apos;ve been taught , and all of the missing health care per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve , then at the end of the day , there &apos;s no way at the end of it .
it depen@@ ds upon a third sentence that doesn &apos;t have anything to do with the first two sent@@ ences , and that &apos;s how the opposite of the first sentence has already been pro@@ posed and predi@@ cted .
this tri@@ be , the co@@ fan , have 17 vari@@ ants of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca that you see all of them in the forest of the forest as a fashion .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are on this distance from the planet to see that they &apos;re not at all .
we see many , many gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes in digital photos that you can get clo@@ th@@ less@@ ly and continu@@ ously , in any way it can be re@@ ar@@ ded .
and the ex@@ ecu@@ tives of the se@@ man@@ tic cros@@ ses and the pul@@ ses that come out of this is really enormous . it &apos;s a classi@@ c network effect effect .
it was im@@ it@@ ated in the cell , and recogni@@ zed the other chromo@@ some as a result , and we just had a cell on a new chromo@@ some .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteri@@ stics of the species , and conver@@ ted it completely into a new species based on the cell that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
we &apos;re going to investi@@ gate whether we can use it , which cannot be able to support the money that could take the co2 into the fuel , to take that process .
and yet , the coal of coal is one of the major reasons of global warming , which is remarkable sau@@ cer technology that you see here , everything else is changing .
they are also working in such an arti@@ stic aspe@@ ct with biological materials , and , as well as electr@@ on@@ ics , and combin@@ ed that , put it in a very separate kind of way .
and then we took a d.@@ d fire apart , and then the burning r@@ ene re@@ f@@ uses to the las@@ er , and then trying to focus on this camera .
so , instead of remem@@ ber@@ ing individu@@ ally , we have standar@@ di@@ zed , very common , in mil@@ ds that we can share our personal lives .
we &apos;ve only brought phosp@@ hor@@ us for two years , and already , through the phosp@@ hor@@ us , we &apos;ve been able to get a lot more in the world &apos;s environment than in all its nuclear diseases .
and because they are working a lot of tou@@ ches than we are , and they live only three to six months , they live in their weight , less than 20 billion people .
now , i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today and i &apos;m going to be on my pal@@ ette of music spi@@ kes much more color@@ ful , emotions and emotions than now .
the food that was fo@@ iled from a che@@ f or a che@@ f , has got to be aten , not just looking at them or reci@@ g@@ ged or reci@@ pes .
that &apos;s a people who are not cogni@@ tively different between colors and green , because the hi@@ tain represents the forest of the forest that people are depen@@ dent upon .
it looks like this , who doesn &apos;t have a rand@@ om@@ ly dis@@ agre@@ ement , can &apos;t be asked for its actions , and so it &apos;s im@@ per@@ ly proud of that .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent rene@@ w@@ able energy , energy per year , not the performance at the right point , then you have to turn it off .
that our system also has a pri@@ mor@@ ty , because we &apos;re not going to do 20 percent with this lights , and also have a price increase in the other things that don &apos;t fail .
so , from that , you also notice that there &apos;s a change there , and only from this dri@@ ll , to the idea that a hundred percent re@@ wind is true .
a lot of argu@@ ments against it is to kill the environment , most of them , most of them , and they are in@@ efficient , we &apos;re taking tun@@ a . a large fra@@ ction .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to ask him to do that , because the love story , like roman@@ tic , is also relevant .
we should call them what it is , a fe@@ ad in a re@@ co@@ very , a fe@@ ad that makes it very , very meaning@@ ful to make that production happen .
now when we go on , we say to age 40 or yo@@ unger , we &apos;ll see that acci@@ dents are even bigger about the fact that people should care .
and my love to science fi@@ ction appe@@ ared in my surro@@ und@@ ings , because at the time , in the late 6@@ 0s , we went to the moon and we started studying the sea .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of deep sea , even in the flat ocean , the way we really think of it is that we really can &apos;t imagine it .
but in the middle of the &apos; 9@@ 0s , we realized that we were in the cre@@ ator , and we think design design -- which we actually created the company , too slow .
you go up into that cap@@ su@@ le , and then you fl@@ ul@@ pt into this dark , ho@@ sti@@ le surro@@ unding environment , where you don &apos;t care if you don &apos;t make it yourself .
i learned a lot about science , but now i &apos;m thinking , well , i &apos;m going to have to be able to do a shel@@ f , a leader like a ship cap@@ tains or something like that .
all of you think , i &apos;m in between ti@@ tan@@ ic , and &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; -- i hat@@ ched the h@@ ills on a beach on a beach .
and in that community , you realize that the most important thing is the understanding that you have in front of each other , because you &apos;ve got a problem that you can explain to you .
arm@@ strong twitter argu@@ ed over us , and then , dec@@ ember , we hon@@ est@@ ed the ti@@ me@@ -@@ magazine , in 2010 , the ti@@ me@@ -@@ magazine of 2010 , which was really nice .
not only do we know that the ability of people to survive and to thri@@ ve from the fight of the human mind is to change through conflict .
and the second thing , as a species , we have our environment re@@ con@@ fig@@ uring our environment , that we &apos;ve been able to ada@@ pt to ourselves as well as we ada@@ pt to them .
so , think of it if it wasn &apos;t just going to choose the gender of your child , but also to prevent genetic adap@@ tations , the diseases that he@@ al and pre@@ ten@@ ds to prevent .
and the deep@@ est of all , we will ever be able to develop wisdom , and the wisdom that we are going to use to make these decisions ?
now , in our city , in the volun@@ t@@ ary store a high-@@ powered professional fire , you &apos;ve got to be pretty early on the hot spot to be partici@@ p@@ ated .
and in this scen@@ ari@@ o , they imagine that in one case the sper@@ m has an y ch@@ om@@ o@@ so@@ m , which goes on to the x chromo@@ some of ir@@ on .
but it &apos;s usually going to take the pu@@ ber@@ ty and grow their broo@@ ding and grow , but they don &apos;t get their period , until someone else is going to be doing something else .
and they &apos;re doing a few tests , and they find out they &apos;re caus@@ ing protein , and they &apos;re really ho@@ ice , and that she has a chromo@@ some chromo@@ some .
they were the notion that people who had political power , they should have made this political force from the grand@@ father to son , and so on .
if you look at the history of the green world , you realize that many of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a science world .
i meet all sorts of great people ; my dollars for usually a good cause ; i see it -- it &apos;s very unique , and it makes it a little personal sh@@ ell .
while i &apos;m doing that , i &apos;m going to give you some of the le@@ lessons that i am , whether you believe it or not , from those ad@@ vent@@ ures , not to contribu@@ te to anything new .
no longer a building that would open up to make it happen , but a building that still brea@@ ks and res@@ on@@ ated in the water , you had to jump without we@@ tting .
and that was , for us , very exciting because architec@@ ts , engineers , as designers , we &apos;re always thinking about how people are using things that we design .
but tomorrow can , to put us the next challenges -- think about climate change , or co2 emissions -- how can we then change from digital world to physical shif@@ ts .
i would write it this way , not the stron@@ gest part of its species , but not the intelligent parts of its way , but the guy who can ada@@ pt the better .
my call to everybody who flies today is : imagine the same thing happening on your flight -- please not -- but how would you change it ?
so when i knew i was going to come here to look at the world in a ted@@ talk , and spon@@ sor@@ ing the world , i knew i would do something a little different .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a real word that these categ@@ ory is really capable of doing something positive , as op@@ posed to &quot; be@@ aten and fire . &quot;
and if they play with their particles , they all have different strange things -- like they fly directly through mau@@ walls , or that they can be at the same time at two different places .
the dri@@ vers are not just human beings , but the light that appe@@ ars on them and the wind that goes on to them and the heat of the room .
and so , i had to create this new intuition that this looks like all the objects are in the el@@ ev@@ ator , which is just a ru@@ g@@ ged in a small room .
it &apos;s so that these connections , conne@@ cting connections with all those things , literally defin@@ ing who you are , and this is the deep and strange of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
in fact , that &apos;s what you look at is the first time more information , as the second time , but i would guess the car that they thought they were in the second time .
i needed to make sure that it wasn &apos;t for free , and it was my job to tell the story that the history was made out of it , but we were over@@ thought .
and there were the ar@@ en@@ s , pain@@ t@@ ary ch@@ ie@@ ge , and here , and there it goes , &quot; asi@@ an , goes home . &quot;
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t change the change , an@@ gry and flexi@@ ble , perman@@ ent children , are cap@@ tured between two worl@@ ds .
i &apos;ve been suffering now to know that , yes , the world is cr@@ ying apart , but not as you fear it .
and we think we want to think that this is one of the major problems of why everyone -- maybe most of the electr@@ onic health projects are missing -- because we stopped listening .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , &quot; there are hundreds of people around the country who are standing up and government cap@@ s writing every day in their communities .
and what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , like man@@ ch others , which we often get into our field , a kind of a se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ y thing .
of course , the stories i was looking for , from the science fi@@ ction area : &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator , &quot; &quot; ali@@ ens &quot; and &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss &quot; .
most of them are digital photos of a camera , but this one , for example , a scan of con@@ gress and it &apos;s in a scale of 300 poly@@ g@@ ta@@ i@@ es .
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma works like this : if our goal is the ma@@ xic@@ on of our citizens , especially the ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing of the individual is through the ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing of the individual .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for pres@@ cri@@ bing drugs for people like you and me , if you think about it , if you don &apos;t buy it , you don &apos;t buy it .
we &apos;ve come up with the second generation and third generation , which is a little bit more likely to have a lot larger than that , which will have a lot more gent@@ le dis@@ order , like oc@@ cent@@ u@@ es or different species of bu@@ tan@@ ol .
and what about the crea@@ tives of creativity is that they make us un@@ certain of each other &apos;s minds -- in a way that others don &apos;t do it ?
everything that you have to do is look at the bit@@ ter death numbers from the 20th century from the 20th century , the j@@ ung and a lot of self-@@ suff@@ i@@ ed .
they believed that creativity was a form of di@@ vin@@ ity , un@@ known source to human beings -- from un@@ expla@@ ined , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known causes .
it could give an ow@@ ner@@ al , wonderful , bizar@@ re collaboration , a kind of conver@@ sa@@ tional conversation , a kind of conver@@ sa@@ tional thing that was not quite tom .
the second thing is that we have been able to talk about this arch@@ a@@ ic model of models in a very , very , very sophisti@@ cated language , even though we &apos;re using a co@@ ordin@@ ated language .
that doesn &apos;t mean that she &apos;s likely to go home four hours of the time , but their emplo@@ yer will tell you , you know , you &apos;re working on the four hours of working with the four hours .
right now , we &apos;re building ma@@ ize , and we lose them between 11 and three kil@@ ogra@@ ms of three kil@@ ogra@@ ms per seas@@ on , or also to calcu@@ late the quad@@ ru@@ ple square .
and i went to ber@@ lin years , because i wanted to make rene@@ w@@ able power , and that was not what it was doing .
there was the way that it was that it was self-@@ admini@@ stration , and one of them was just sitting in cros@@ s-@@ mountain , where you thought about evil .
she came from a man , afri@@ can@@ -@@ american , sym@@ pathy , ro@@ u , hom@@ eless , who had just been on a san@@ e that had only two sa@@ i@@ ons .
i dre@@ w my father until he finally finally finally had a di@@ ve school in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york had done , right at the other side of the bor@@ der , where we lived .
now , from all people i &apos;ve met , the kog@@ i was out of si@@ er@@ ra ne@@ v@@ ada de s@@ ant@@ a mar@@ ta , the most extraordinary .
because , you know , i could imagine myself a cre@@ ature that we could create a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see in the window of fen@@ sters .
it &apos;s very different to say , well , we &apos;ve got a 3@@ .@@ 0 high tru@@ ck that has to be under a three-@@ meter bridge , which is that you can then do it underneath .
and we start by taking the g@@ arb@@ age , which is already available in these re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators or tro@@ s@@ qui@@ to , which is our strong fuel .
and fortunately , there are do@@ zens of companies today , and we need hundreds of them , the ones that are working , including their pil@@ es , which can contribu@@ te to their pil@@ ots .
it dem@@ ands that we are all using our senses , and that we are using our thinking of opti@@ mal , how our emotions are and our organization , in the challenge that we are facing .
drin@@ king water , the world &apos;s rain@@ fore@@ sts , oil , gas -- they disappe@@ ar , and in case we don &apos;t get out of that chaos , we &apos;re also suffering from this chaos .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that brought the autis@@ m epidemic epidemic with the mas@@ ses , mu@@ mp@@ s and tube vac@@ cin@@ es combin@@ ed .
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do that as much as we do , i think we don &apos;t want to be gu@@ il@@ ty to be high-@@ tech col@@ oni@@ alism .
in fact , the white p@@ ill is not as good as the blue p@@ ill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a cap@@ su@@ le that doesn &apos;t work as well as the key .
i have some people on the number of books that have been published with &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and there was about 40 , and there was a lot more .
that &apos;s true of la@@ va , which is thinking about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are just like everyone else .
for that self , a second ch@@ ie@@ f is har@@ dly better than the na@@ tive vac@@ ation , because there are no new memor@@ ies to be add@@ ressed .
now , very brie@@ fly , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t think about the same things when we think about life and actually live .
it &apos;s going to be a while , and people are going to be discus@@ sing whether they want to study the experience of life , or whether they want to study the discussion of life , so we need to start a discussion .
it &apos;s ur@@ gen@@ cy optimis@@ m , which is , immediately , to do a little bar@@ rier , with the faith that we have a strong hop@@ ing hop@@ ing increase in success .
that never happened in the history of technology development , this type of rec@@ ur@@ si@@ le growth , by which the order of all few years of exponenti@@ ally increas@@ ed .
in fact , the dro@@ p@@ ta@@ bs , which had an opti@@ mal@@ -@@ sensitive to the growth of the other , more and more chemicals and more chemicals were faster .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home , and brought this fab@@ ul@@ ous bi@@ er with my sister and i went to the forest .
it &apos;s hard to tell us to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we are not will@@ ling , we &apos;re not going to be willing to engage the truth of the truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
now , with all our digital devices that us seven days a week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not mira@@ cle that we are a mira@@ cle .
so in the last month , i had the pleasure of the qu@@ al@@ as@@ a foundation that &apos;s called the &quot; $ 10 million demand com@@ o@@ der . &quot;
suppose you have a blind in@@ struc@@ tor , and you become a sur@@ ren@@ dered ag@@ ent whose average performance has 400 in the blin@@ k of it .
and i went through the same tor@@ ture of sh@@ an@@ ge and self-@@ dou@@ bt , felt re@@ gre@@ sted and went back to the work until it happened and again and again .
the transi@@ st@@ or was a little plastic unit that would occu@@ p@@ y us from a world of sta@@ tic steel blocks in the world of everything that would be inter@@ active .
now , if we succe@@ ed , the systems and val@@ ves and val@@ ves can actually change a lot of problems with the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , can actually cause a lot of problems with the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
this is a gra@@ ff@@ iti in my former home in ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , california , where i studied in my ph@@ d , why we are better than living in the real life .
so we have a full par@@ alle@@ l way of learning that young people are learning what it means to be a good player , like anything else you &apos;re learning in school .
i know they &apos;re going to solve , &quot; how do we solve problems of the real world in games in the last year or so that i &apos;ve de@@ dic@@ ated to the future for the future to the future .
we have all this super@@ power@@ s , happ@@ ier produ@@ c@@ tivity , the ability to kn@@ it en@@ vel@@ op@@ e and demand , and demand that to ep@@ ic meaning .
and the reason it would be for us , for the first time , is to main@@ tain a lot of genes that would have been picked up , and the population had been re@@ moved from the population .
play is a sha@@ per , and it can take a lot of shapes from which some people are more quie@@ t to discover phan@@ ie@@ ght -- perhaps to discover the amazing again .
and when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he was men@@ om@@ ly in the fact that the doctors found out that he was in the middle of it .
and part of me is what if the content would be something that would be add@@ ressed in the future of machine -- using f@@ mr@@ i visible ?
but then it could just be a 3d cloud out of sculp@@ ts that you can go to , and you can walk through them , which you can look at from many , many direc@@ tions .
i have a company , the design and anima@@ tion , so gra@@ ff@@ iti is inevi@@ t@@ ably a complex fra@@ ction of what we face in the art@@ world .
first , we &apos;ve got the in@@ sur@@ ance in@@ sur@@ ance , and in fact , they get a device that he can communicate with -- a ste@@ er haw@@ king machine .
i have the sen@@ sation that if we make vac@@ ation really often , that means , we &apos;re doing vac@@ ation wisdom in the service of mind itself .
the use of the use is trans@@ formed in the gra@@ y box , dama@@ ged the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and the ir@@ ani@@ an nuclear power program -- ex@@ ecu@@ tion .
and my friends , the large , gigan@@ tic h@@ arb@@ ist movies , says that the reason their films are so successful is that their films are so successful at the brand party that they have .
18 months ago , i was doing something else at google , and i was talking to you about muse@@ ums and art -- my che@@ f@@ in , which is also in my green light .
but i bet that it &apos;s a very valuable thing to do with the th@@ res@@ hold , which is the big things you don &apos;t just leave yourself , and that you stay in a position .
in that we gave him a little push , we could put it into the same time , not too vi@@ br@@ ating -- something which is just quant@@ um in quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
so what i &apos;d like to offer you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve te@@ sted in different ways and different research systems -- they can &apos;t use them in their own business .
you see , what we &apos;ve been looking forward to , and how we &apos;ve been formed , we can now see that the men that might have thought in our lives that might have come to facebook .
so these communities started evol@@ ving themselves so that the level that evolution was happening , it was no longer the individual cell , but the entire cell community that we call the organis@@ m .
and at the end of the day , i grab@@ bed the hospital and i went to the par@@ king lot , when i did something i wasn &apos;t doing .
two years later , i had a service in the emergen@@ cy hospital in a commun@@ al hospital of tor@@ onto and i took a 25@@ -year-old guy with a 4@@ 0-@@ year-old ra@@ w .
so if we think about these sorts of things , the obvious response of people would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t matter , because i &apos;m a bra@@ ve citizens .
that means that if we look , we can trans@@ fer that exi@@ sting mobile models of a matter of something else , like the metaphor , then i can u@@ tili@@ ze it .
now , i understand you right ? your software en@@ ab@@ ling that in a particular time , in the next year , all pictures that are used by someone in the world to connect from someone in the world ?
we can watch our kids look at foot@@ ball , and we have our mobile phone on a hi@@ p , and our black@@ ber@@ ry is probably on our la@@ p .
and the exciting phase came when we took this piece of chemical chemical , and in a bacteri@@ um , the bacteri@@ um started to read the genetic code and made virus partic@@ le particles .
my dad , for example , was chem@@ ist and i can &apos;t mind myself in his 40 years as a chem@@ ist , he asked if he was afraid to be chem@@ ist .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything that i &apos;m going to write about now is the way that i &apos;m going to write about the world that &apos;s been successful on the des@@ ks of my own book , right ?
that &apos;s why we put it to the top line , to spend an inten@@ tional amount of money in the way to make the truth about coal .
we begin to bring the management voice in two sequence , and they put it in a row , they exp@@ and and add a little more of voice .
the book of the book of the book , ju@@ a@@ than &apos;s god , we still associ@@ ate a year to a hundred hours of a hundred hours per year of re@@ cep@@ ti@@ le of stories .
but to me , in a particularly extraordinary media , as a particularly impres@@ sive , we have the ability to think of non@@ power@@ s , the ability to think of non@@ lin@@ ear .
so , of course , in the context of my talk , we might be able to dis@@ count , we &apos;re not going to be able to engineer , virtual worl@@ ds , very , very close to the model of the h@@ olo@@ de@@ angle .
so , very , very exciting processes that then , in this , is actually not , but here &apos;s a lot of this jun@@ k mass .
we have to deal with the un@@ stopp@@ able dis@@ connect , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dan@@ cing and art .
just the things that dis@@ count , like the bra@@ gue tree , like auth@@ or@@ es , like auth@@ or@@ es , have got to be that they have to go to biological systems .
how big would it have to be a battery so that you can have an island on 20 , 40 , 40 , maybe even se@@ vent@@ able percent rene@@ w@@ able .
and the wind plant , or the solar system , or whatever it is , is usually a little ris@@ ky system , which is just a little bit of a system that can store just in small amo@@ unts of numbers here .
and in fact , in b@@ b@@ c , it &apos;s in b@@ b@@ c &apos;s years in b@@ b@@ c man@@ n@@ heim , today , we &apos;ve been developed , and then it was re@@ lie@@ ved to the japanese .
and we &apos;re just trying to make sure that the capacity of the capacity to use the capacity to produce electro@@ chemical .
and that &apos;s a little bit of our vision of a reas@@ on@@ able power , and i &apos;m also gr@@ ate@@ ful that they were used to use sun@@ energy .
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; only for the facts , you &apos;re famous to grow the sea , you &apos;re famous to grow the environment . &quot;
and we ship to the corner , and we look at the most incredible vie@@ wing , thousands and thousands of pain@@ t@@ br@@ uses , just a little bit of the eye .
now , when i &apos;ve ele@@ cted the government &apos; water , i realize that the wi@@ pe@@ di@@ ac@@ at@@ at@@ ori@@ ums that cover the most part of the year is &quot; human beings &quot; of the year .
some people say , you don &apos;t even need to work on the in@@ sur@@ ance , because that perhaps it &apos;s a ration@@ ale , so you know that you &apos;re going to save the heart proce@@ d@@ ure .
so , i &apos;m suggest@@ ing when it &apos;s going to be very quick , then look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first hot thing here on the back .
so , it &apos;s exactly like the h@@ arb@@ or movies , where the follo@@ w-@@ up video video recor@@ ded video recor@@ ded with video recor@@ ded video .
we &apos;re going to move games to make it happen in the real world that don &apos;t work in the real world , and we don &apos;t really want to get us to play from the games .
maybe this is the idea of just paying attention to what &apos;s happening in a broken failure , and how we fix that , to every single dis@@ ability than the path@@ ology .
if we don &apos;t even treat a human , and don &apos;t percei@@ ve all its power@@ s and possibility , we can also get to the natural fight that you may have to lead to , another disease .
that was dr. ke@@ an , a man i knew only from my mother about this day , because i was , of course , very typical at my birthday two weeks .
they &apos;re not other than anything that they put together in the morning , and they give them extra strength , and that &apos;s going to help them go up , for example , their balance .
we know what we call &quot; love &quot; of war , because they have more ex@@ ecu@@ tives sex , and the way conflict and social angel@@ s and social angel@@ s .
and therefore , my pri@@ mates , let &apos;s leave this gift of evolution hu@@ hu@@ dly , and together , as we re@@ disco@@ vering the creativity of the cr@@ ony and re@@ disco@@ vering the sta@@ irs .
and maybe it &apos;s the way we go in the future when we carry democracy over autonom@@ y -- less about the individual bodies to think about what identity is about , and more about rela@@ tives .
i just want to leave myself with him , and i said , &quot; wait a second , that &apos;s not -- i &apos;ve seen that haw@@ king haw@@ king -- can &apos;t communicate all the paraly@@ sis of these devices ? &quot;
so i came up with a need , just to put a taste out of it , and instead i made a check out of that i had no idea how to resol@@ ve it .
i &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it much as much as to save the world in the context .
there are many people who would like to look at america in america , especially a place of freedom zone , and there are many people who would like to live there .
so close the people who decided to be more connected to them , the more possibilities they were available to choose , the more things they have to choose , the more f@@ on@@ ds they have .
each dollar has been divi@@ ded , and it was transl@@ ated in other education for english and mathematics , whatever we needed to do , most of the new things that came from two hand .
but it &apos;s this temp@@ t that this thing that we have , and for the reason we pay , something that works against us , something else , and then we started ourselves .
so if somebody wants a hundred million cop@@ ies of my business card , i &apos;ve got enough for everyone in this room , and it &apos;s exactly right here .
tele@@ phones , computers , ri@@ vers , c@@ d-@@ ro@@ ms and so on are all our speci@@ alized mechanis@@ ms that we made in our communities that have made this information .
take two programs , and they produce children through the exchange of their su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es , and the children surro@@ unded the characteri@@ stics of the su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es from the two programs .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction in which you use the video of the i@@ pa@@ ds , and you see a anima@@ tion of el@@ ev@@ es that appear on a plant in front of the house .
and there was another nur@@ se , not the sister who had seen the sister , but a different three words to me , and that number three words seemed to be afraid that i know .
the beautiful thing is , in fact , that you can take this island in the island today that we &apos;re going to take it all the way to the problems that we get when we want to increase our fra@@ ction of rene@@ w@@ ables .
it &apos;s kind of like taking a s@@ w@@ der out of a tissue of a tissue , surro@@ unded by b@@ aro@@ que pain@@ t@@ ings and the land@@ land on a sea of electricity .
a collea@@ gue of mine had access to invest@@ ments of van@@ gu@@ ard , the giant f@@ on@@ d@@ able community of about a million collabor@@ ator and about 2,000 different jobs .
we find all sorts of species here that recor@@ ded a second chromo@@ some , or a third of anything , every time thousands of these characteri@@ stics are in just a one-@@ to-@@ one dimension .
there are also some nice things in education like languages , mathematics or logi@@ cal games , where we want to give the people the opportunity to create the fast eye bi@@ er , and immediately see the results .
a project that i &apos;ve done with the ha@@ ck@@ ens network in swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land was that we wanted to be an oper@@ a lea@@ p or op@@ tical br@@ et .
what that means is , if you look at that now , look at who you look at long , because i &apos;m not going to take an ele@@ ction for what &apos;s going on here .
these are the first shoes that you can put the ca@@ val@@ on start , and you can go to biological cir@@ cles in biological cir@@ cles , right ?
so there &apos;s no ex@@ ception to that , you know , because you can learn it , only passi@@ vely , or you can also talk to language until the musical mother .
if in an environment , when the adults are doing music , or at least listen to music , a child is growing up , then it &apos;s very easy for a teacher to ask the color ?
this plant con@@ tains some very strong tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ins that are ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ vin@@ yp@@ tam@@ in a very similar way .
na@@ than@@ iel left ju@@ an li@@ ard , suff@@ ered a neuron and 30 years later , he lived as a hom@@ ist on the streets of los angeles .
and i &apos;m going to keep doing that with na@@ than@@ iel music , whether it &apos;s in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney shares ti@@ ming , or in magnetic row , because he re@@ minds me of why i &apos;ve grown to musi@@ cians .
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my belo@@ ved fish that was deli@@ cious , and i don &apos;t like skin skin . i don &apos;t love it .
after the success of ti@@ tan@@ ic , i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my hom@@ ist film@@ maker in hollywood , and i &apos;m going to put a time resear@@ cher . &quot;
now , the ex@@ act relationship between a co@@ 2 rise and the combin@@ ation of temper@@ atures of temper@@ atures and where else are the consequences , there are some distin@@ c@@ ence , but not many .
the average for most of them is about 50@@ ths , b@@ w@@ l students creating half of them , law@@ yers are more , but not much , child gar@@ den-@@ children are better than adults .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe in an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es , we believe , what we &apos;re seeing is what we &apos;re seeing , what we &apos;re seeing is that we feel real .
and the third is the concent@@ ration illusion , and that &apos;s the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we can &apos;t think about a circum@@ stance that affec@@ ts the well-@@ being .
the distin@@ ction between the common self and the satis@@ fac@@ tion of memory is in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separate .
now , the brain lo@@ se@@ test epidemic , where we &apos;re in the world , this ab@@ sur@@ d struggle between the sc@@ or@@ es , and the bio@@ -@@ eli@@ te food and the bio@@ -@@ eli@@ te .
you might think that the problem is people who are sur@@ ely when they lived in predat@@ or societies , they were killing animals , and they had only been aware of a few generations of what they had done .
yes , there are 9@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent of sal@@ ine water , two percent , and we struggle to fight 0@@ .@@ 5 percent of the water on the planet , but there are also hope .
in this year , you &apos;ve been able to reduce the cost of solar power in india for the first time -- 8@@ .@@ 8 ru@@ pe@@ es compared to 17 ru@@ pe@@ es compared to 17 ru@@ pe@@ es compared to 17 ru@@ pe@@ es compared to 17 ru@@ pe@@ es .
there are no limit@@ ation to the technology and design that will allow us to be human and human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and in@@ justice .
the head@@ line is now there , where these communities are so sick together , they decided to write the reci@@ pe for the whole community in a chain chain .
so they either survive together , or they went together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals in the community of community have been repe@@ ated and pre@@ ci@@ pit@@ ating from evolution .
so if the transpor@@ tation technology was advan@@ cing as fast as the micro@@ process@@ or , then we could go to a tax@@ i , and in 30 seconds we would be in to@@ k@@ yo .
ta@@ ste@@ ka , creativity communities , completely un@@ expected , are the characteri@@ stics of a new kind of media and culture that has determin@@ ed to every access to the audience .
the small thing that we &apos;ve put down was that we asked people to think about positive things that would happen to their lives in their lives , if they were saving money .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of hon@@ dur@@ as who meant that we need to do this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way to bring our land to it .
and there are some pretty much about the tou@@ ches of the street &apos;s be@@ ars here -- bank sy , she@@ par@@ d fa@@ i@@ re@@ y , ca@@ ll@@ d fa@@ i@@ re@@ y -- all these guys are being there .
the cool@@ est thing about it is -- and that inclu@@ des the whole circle -- that this apri@@ l , in the middle of the city , will be an exhi@@ bi@@ tion called &quot; the way of the streets . &quot;
it started with a question of the ma@@ yo@@ r who came and said that spa@@ in and southern europe have a beautiful tradition to use water as part of the architecture .
but the other thing is , we think that if we see each day , the c@@ up that we throw away is not just disappe@@ aring out that they &apos;re still going out somewhere else on the planet .
and to be honest , the only real and lead dis@@ ability that i needed to get apart is that the world always thinks she could describe me with these defin@@ es .
so , i want to take you on a trip to a trip , a quick trip through eth@@ no@@ sphere , to try to make them realize what &apos;s actually lost .
this is the great time that it exi@@ sted on this planet , no matter how to measure it , health , wealth , re@@ lie@@ ving diseases .
she made me aware of this tele@@ pres@@ ence that you use such robo@@ tic a@@ vat@@ ars , and so your conscious mind can spread in the vehicle , in these other form of existence , in these other form of existence .
this is the reason why we do music , so that we put something in all of us deep inside , our emotions , through our own in@@ genu@@ ity , can transform our creativity through our own lives .
and when this tree th@@ res@@ as then per@@ su@@ aded people , then he &apos;s filled with the spirit , with nature , with nature , with nature , only with se@@ l .
if we put ourselves back in the real@@ m of the software , the first comm@@ and line , the first comm@@ and line , which were very abstra@@ ct , where you needed months to deal with it .
and finally , how can i get to a certain dest@@ ination , or how can i possibly get a user in a particular use of use , efficient and reli@@ able , efficient and a goal .
children , old , all kinds of people go to ex@@ clu@@ si@@ ble them , they have a lab set up and look at what can you do when these labor@@ at@@ es go .
here in the upp@@ er on the top here , bio@@ scap@@ es , that &apos;s a ha@@ cker space , basically a kind of a school , a private school , a non-@@ profit , a non@@ profit , a non@@ profit , a non@@ profit , a non@@ profit , a non@@ profit , a non@@ profit , a non@@ profit , a non@@ profit , a non@@ profit , a non@@ profit , a non@@ profit , a non@@ profit , a non@@ profit , a non@@ profit , a non@@ profit , a non@@ profit , a non@@ profit , a non@@ profit .
if you may only believe that they are a re@@ lie@@ ved -- from a uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able source for a re@@ writing of her life that will pass on someone else when they were finished .
somehow , i have to find some way to write a safe distance to make a safe distance between myself and my very natural main@@ stream about how the reaction to that is going to be .
now , of course , in some kind of de@@ ar cases , the debate are the debate about the worth of science and engineering of engineering of such boundar@@ ies . it &apos;s easy to dis@@ count .
and even when all of them are turned on , every minute we &apos;re looking at our kid , we &apos;ll also ask ourselves , &quot; should i embra@@ ce this call ?
and that really gives them the pleasure and the good experience to read a paper lec@@ ture or a newspaper , which is a kind of a medium of a multi-@@ scale of sc@@ ales .
they represent parts of human imagination that go back in past times , and for everyone , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , the dreams of our own children , the dreams of our own children , like the dreams of our own children .
the si@@ ou@@ x ow@@ ans didn &apos;t bel@@ ong to be si@@ ou@@ ster@@ ed when she was ar@@ med and ar@@ row tas@@ ks , when the americans were dying to be the hor@@ ses and hor@@ s@@ car tas@@ ks .
the great car that you &apos;ve ever met , from &quot; the the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; re@@ gre@@ t &quot; is the greatest pen@@ e@@ print that you &apos;ve ever had , and you &apos;ve ever had an attention from the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; re@@ brea@@ ks . &quot;
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science that if we spend 10,000 hours talking about the ti@@ dying of a random matter to the 21@@ st year , we &apos;ll be able to get to sters in it .
he &apos;s called dr. pi@@ z called dr. pi@@ z , whose name is how you can think of yourself , most americans don &apos;t speak right .
in this year , we celebra@@ ted 200 birthday birthday from charles darwin and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , he said , &quot; in my mind , in a very truly true place .
you realize that we can use it , and the mechanis@@ ms of a common bacteri@@ um can be used to produce the protein of the human insu@@ lin , which is used to treat diab@@ e@@ tics .
now , i want you to imagine a tra@@ gic tool that gives them human cap@@ abilities , or another , the wheel@@ chair that helps them to stand up and go .
so if i look around in this room , and people see that they &apos;ve been able to do a lot of a th@@ res@@ hold success , and they &apos;re going to be able to do this . don &apos;t want to do that .
they went away from expla@@ ining explan@@ ations , and things like an over@@ natural concept of power , where the trans@@ mission of power is based upon a very va@@ se concept of birth .
the car@@ row stri@@ p in the gra@@ y box , when a special con@@ figu@@ ration has been discovered , even if that &apos;s a special program that &apos;s been able to work on this goal .
what is obvious , obviously , that money can &apos;t com@@ bine an experience of happiness , but that lack of money of money is sur@@ ely meas@@ uring , and we can measure this very strong , very clearly measure .
but the nin@@ th super@@ market , the world today &apos;s largest super@@ market in the world is al@@ di , and they only offer them 1,@@ 400 products -- some kind of to@@ ma@@ to sau@@ ce sau@@ ce in do@@ se .
without support of their man@@ ners , they made a conversation by dis@@ rup@@ ting it , and he had a lot of money in their own case , and a bigger shift than she won .
but one particular fellow , a man named er@@ ik ehrlich el@@ s-@@ nigeri@@ ans , and that was the fact that the resi@@ dents were breaking up the citi@@ zen@@ s directly before sharing those bits .
it can generate thousands of gall@@ drin@@ king drin@@ king water per day -- whether sal@@ ine water , cont@@ amin@@ ated water , la@@ r@@ ins -- and all that for less than two cents per cent .
and in fact , if i knew that there was an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c in my hospital , then you would believe that i &apos;d had some problems in the eyes .
the new in@@ definitely adap@@ ted doctor is a human , he knows about his humanity , she &apos;s not proud of expla@@ ining er@@ ror , so does anything to learn from it so that it can be made out of it so that it can be made out of it .
the u.s. intelligence agen@@ cy announ@@ ced the s@@ wis@@ s con@@ account of mr. sam ja@@ in here , and on this account there were 14@@ .@@ 9 million u.s. dollars as it was fro@@ zen .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that can measure the power of a system like this is the number of pi@@ x@@ les on your screen every moment , it has a very flexi@@ ble architecture .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for living itself , and it &apos;s not even relevant to the thinking self that deci@@ des how happy people are .
it &apos;s still going to be , because of its former stories , with the skep@@ tic@@ ism camp , but he understood that this is a very distin@@ ctive group , and so he understood the research now .
because it &apos;s because you &apos;re very short just a cur@@ vement , and it only fin@@ ds the edu@@ cational cur@@ ve . i think we should try to try more things that have the potential to be much lower .
we should use the efficiency requi@@ re@@ ments to get redu@@ ction in the way , the less we will be the carbon dio@@ xide , and it &apos;s also the temperature .
the ter@@ ra@@ x concept is that instead of a part of the ur@@ an , the one percent , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 .
and so , you get an idea that if you make information through this kind of information , more pr@@ ou@@ ter , more zo@@ om , you zo@@ om out , you don &apos;t just see it .
and if you have one way to feel these three choices in other people , they do it , because they &apos;re going to make it happy if they don &apos;t remember their own su@@ its .
in this case , we have three si@@ de@@ walk dis@@ pos@@ l@@ ates , and i can use it to use color in the middle in the middle , where they &apos;re mix@@ ed .
an interesting sequence of the inter@@ actions that we started to see was that we could use everyday gest@@ ures on data , how to do that with li@@ qui@@ ds .
if the du@@ m@@ b fa@@ ke , which makes you put it on the side , it deci@@ ds a little bit of mira@@ cles through your effort , then ol@@ Ã© ! se@@ p .
we have auth@@ ors seem to have this kind of repu@@ tation , but not just the auth@@ ors , they seem to have the repu@@ tation , ment@@ ally un@@ stable .
you know , we really -- moder@@ ate tar@@ gets like the total pe@@ tro@@ chemical industry . right ? if you couldn &apos;t do that at ted , where else can you do that ? a source source of energy .
part of the design is to create pieces of letters long , and they have to trans@@ fer the other 5@@ 0-@@ letter tru@@ ck to build smaller sub@@ un@@ its that can fit these inter@@ actions .
work -- we &apos;re bl@@ essed , as car@@ l has con@@ ger@@ ed , with the technology that allows us every minute of every day on the planet -- until the rand@@ om@@ ra hotel .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text , and not about a picture , we can do something like this , that this is a real repres@@ entation of the tex@@ ts and no image .
in a lot of the light of the light world , through other beings , through new ways of building it , there are many services that have a lot of services to reduce 90 percent services .
if you think about &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; if you think about why people were tou@@ ched -- except by the po@@ ca@@ hon@@ al story , why were they so tou@@ ched from the ima@@ gery ?
in fact , it was so embar@@ ras@@ sed to tell me that i asked her the nur@@ se , which was the woman , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay if you go home ? &quot;
it went like 15 or 20 minutes , and then she came up and she came to me over her hand , and she said , &quot; hu@@ m , br@@ y@@ an , you and i , we have to talk . &quot;
so every morning , i went to my wo@@ ke wa@@ sters and people talk to me before i sit in the car : &quot; to lunch , just a little sal@@ ate today , &quot; a little s@@ at . &quot;
now if you look at the extreme look , the plans , the plans , the two thre@@ at@@ en@@ ds , there was still a partic@@ le in the 197@@ 0s -- still not as much as we want it .
and i &apos;ve used this ch@@ art to show how valuable ro@@ hl@@ and is in a place like new york -- think about a surface in some cases per square meter per square meter .
rather than that , it &apos;s just lying there , and the way it was , the way it was -- like this , it was like this -- like a repli@@ w@@ uring and lin@@ ed together .
so , extra@@ cted and de@@ com@@ hy@@ li@@ cted , we found that he &apos;s progra@@ mm@@ ed in two digital thre@@ at@@ heads -- a smaller and a larger scale .
and that question should be , every single day of each day , which requires something that needs to be done . if not now , then when then , if not now , then when ? and if not now , if not now , then when ? and if not now , when you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , if you don &apos;t , then
this is a cheap sun@@ glas@@ ses that we bought on the ri@@ ice of ven@@ ice , a little bit of a horse and a few things from the building market and the electr@@ on@@ ics exchange .
no@@ wa@@ days , we can last for the first time -- and the campaign has shown him -- can we change from the digital world , from which self-@@ organi@@ zing forces in the physical world .
as you all remember , our strength fa@@ thers re@@ turned the concept of mon@@ arch@@ y , and the mon@@ arch@@ y based based on a very simpli@@ stic concept of autonom@@ y .
now we can actually do it . and , of course , there are risks . but we can do something like vi@@ tam@@ in a in ri@@ ce , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , their lives .
as soon as the first thing &apos;s done , when it tra@@ vels , it &apos;s all very clear because the economic business is so different than nuclear energy , as we know .
if you &apos;ve seen the y@@ an@@ o@@ mom@@ i , as you &apos;ve seen this stuff , the sub@@ stance that you &apos;ve got from different sorts of var@@ ie@@ ties also con@@ tains metho@@ d@@ able y@@ i@@ el@@ d .
so i started a company , with my good friend harv@@ wind@@ ston , who was at the same time of the best ma@@ ke@@ -@@ up -- it was called &quot; digital do@@ main . &quot;
they created a 1@@ 1,000 he@@ c@@ ac@@ re fish -- bar@@ k , se@@ ats , gar@@ n@@ els , and the company , the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical destro@@ ance , completely elimin@@ ated the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical destruction .
and from that sou@@ l , they now think that they kind of stick in these clou@@ dies of nature , in this crow@@ ded nature , to be present .
in either , it &apos;s not too late to start to find out if you can &apos;t do it , or learn how to put those little mus@@ cles in the order of the vot@@ es .
and if you put it to people when you say it , if you say it , you wouldn &apos;t be there , you &apos;re not going to be there , then you &apos;re re@@ lie@@ ving .
o@@ kol@@ o@@ cular is about five to 17 thousand times from us , so in the bedro@@ om , you found that there &apos;s less often a lot of crime than the day .
if you are more intui@@ tive , then i have to get back to my little friend , and look at what does this mean to mean from the cognitive point of terror@@ ism , when is it really an intui@@ tive ?
of course , designers don &apos;t just occu@@ r to the subject of per@@ cep@@ tual and neu@@ ral process@@ ing or cognitive programs , of course , to the subject of human obje@@ c@@ tives , but of course , to the subject of human obje@@ c@@ tors .
the right circle looks larger than the little , although that &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s very common , and yet , our perception changed , depen@@ ds upon what context we put things in the context of things where we put things in the context .
and when i say a computer game , they have very likely to have a lot of eyes in front of some of the people who are tex@@ ting around each other , or with any con@@ so@@ le in the hand .
we all know that the inter@@ active media is in non-@@ lin@@ liber@@ al , which invol@@ ves the lin@@ ity of the lin@@ ear@@ ity , and of course , we say that we are the lin@@ ity of normal@@ ity as normal .
it was like having time to stand up and the dan@@ cers through a kind of p@@ lot , and he did nothing else than he had ever done before -- but everything else was putting together .
that &apos;s how the future might look to change with change today , the evolution of evolution can be acceler@@ ated with syn@@ thetic bacteria , arch@@ a@@ es and possibly poten@@ tially eu@@ po@@ yp@@ es .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to syn@@ thes@@ i@@ ze the chromo@@ some , which is actually allo@@ wing individual components , and so some of these fundamental questions .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential to change the life of future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or am@@ on@@ gst all the other wheel@@ chair , but for everyone else .
then i take the same patient with ch@@ est pain , s@@ w@@ ells it , and i &apos;m going to give it a little bit of al@@ co@@ ho@@ li@@ zed breath , and all of a sudden , the history is through con@@ temp@@ t .
and i started with this as@@ sign@@ ment , and the head@@ line said , &quot; con@@ mission , my arms , 14@@ -year-old black po@@ sters like a privi@@ le@@ ged , white , 7@@ 5@@ -year-old po@@ und mana@@ ger . so , .
i live from building computers and i know i &apos;m using the mechan@@ ism that i use to build computers , not use the long term advan@@ ces in computer technology .
in other words , they have found a way to find evolutionary art a way that allowed them to de@@ fau@@ le , so that this information could be saved and cop@@ i@@ ed them .
and we ask our colleagues all over the world , from other universi@@ ties , to help us solve the be@@ ds of things like this , like not to imple@@ ment these habit@@ at points around the world around the world .
can i give you a bu@@ g in your life , which is coura@@ ge@@ ous every wave dr@@ one , which is the slo@@ wing of the engine that doesn &apos;t guar@@ an@@ tee ?
i don &apos;t remember the pir@@ ates , many times , but from the death toll of the men on our boat , they dec@@ ei@@ ve or dec@@ ei@@ ve the slo@@ pe of the engine that doesn &apos;t start six hours .
each of these techniques that i share with you today is to help the possibilities of management -- good for them , you can use them for yourself , good for the people that they provide service .
and it &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call it yo@@ da , because you talk to him , or you get an email , and you &apos;re thinking , &quot; i &apos;m so sick , this guy is incredible . &quot;
i go to my recor@@ dings of this ice mountain , as if i could do portra@@ its of my ancestors , in the conscious mind that they exi@@ sted in these individual sight , and never yet exi@@ sted .
this is to say , &quot; there might be something , &quot; on average , what fe@@ min@@ ine brains make us much more interested in highly complex social relationships .
so , for example , texas at a point , texas decided that you don &apos;t have a man to mar@@ ry a man , you don &apos;t have a nin@@ th of chromo@@ some .
as we increase our science , we &apos;re going to get more and more in a zone of the un@@ aids , where we have to recognize that the pla@@ stic categ@@ ories that we &apos;ve been able to do is too simple .
well , if there &apos;s lots and lots of alterna@@ tives , it &apos;s just attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures that you ex@@ clu@@ de , which you have cho@@ sen to do with the alterna@@ tives that you &apos;ve cho@@ sen .
from an evolutionary stand@@ point , they are and me , as i was ra@@ ke@@ -@@ ra@@ ke@@ ed to send the genetic fra@@ ps in the next level of orbit to the ocean .
and maybe this change could also change because i met so many people who have opened up tur@@ es , rather than hit@@ ting people who were lin@@ ked to en@@ counter me or give me an idea .
first of all , for children in the u.@@ s , 10@@ .@@ 0@@ 1 hours of the united states , they spend a lot of the time they spend in school , from 5@@ th grade -- if you don &apos;t have to be f@@ ed .
imagine your next ur@@ b , you know , at the end of the vac@@ ation , all your images will be thro@@ wn out , and you get an am@@ ne@@ ast treatment , so you can &apos;t be remem@@ ber@@ ed .
none of them -- g@@ ing@@ ko , lab@@ el@@ ed , ac@@ hi@@ ac@@ e@@ ated , ac@@ u@@ red , i don &apos;t even know what this is , but we don &apos;t even give billions dollars for it .
the idea is pretty simple . four teams have got to rele@@ ase the scale of the world with 20 ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i , about 1@@ 1@@ k , about 12@@ 80 times , and building a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
there &apos;s a research facili@@ ty that &apos;s called the ge@@ o@@ engineering , which invol@@ ves with different techniques to raid warming , so that we were paying for 20 or 30 years .
b@@ g : when you get into this situation , it &apos;s like having too much , and shor@@ tly in front of a heart attack , what do you do ? you might need a heart surgery or something else .
this is a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster re@@ actor , and some countries have built that , so everyone who has been traff@@ i@@ zing a fast re@@ actor , a can@@ di@@ date for our first .
if we are very successful with new vac@@ cin@@ es , the health supply and re@@ production medicine , we could do that for 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time , we &apos;ll see a slo@@ wer about 1.@@ 3 percent .
pi@@ vo@@ t , this app@@ lic@@ ation -- i don &apos;t want to call it a brow@@ ser ; it &apos;s really not brow@@ ser , but you can look at web@@ sites like this -- and we &apos;ll bring them to all of these zo@@ om@@ -@@ technology to every single website like this .
if you &apos;re looking at these 20 million different genes , or to optimi@@ ze the processes to create new vac@@ cin@@ es , we can change a little bit more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
if something from the people of our societies en@@ ables people to make decisions , they wouldn &apos;t just improve the lives of people , but our dig@@ ni@@ ty would also be impro@@ ved .
it &apos;s about the fact that people can understand the difference between opportunities to understand which consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that does not need to be filled with the consequences .
car@@ ni@@ fication and the dec@@ line of the c@@ ables is that you can &apos;t fill in a sta@@ dium with your connection -- and even there we are , not sure to be honest .
the sequence is that somebody like me actually has a brain that more and@@ ro@@ ve@@ more than a woman who was born with ho@@ ods and a and@@ ro@@ gens de@@ mis@@ e .
so , we have the concept that a woman is called a female identity ; a black person to be heard , is to be an african person in terms of its own history .
and as a con@@ sequence , we &apos;re at the fight with the real tough question , when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really heavy situation that we don &apos;t have anymore in the very easy categ@@ ories .
you see the picture of the pla@@ te cir@@ cl@@ es , where the ro@@ man time , the people go to celebra@@ tion -- to have a large party , and you see the out@@ beat at the end of the day .
the ice bu@@ gs surro@@ unded around me at 60 feet out of the water , and i could just sta@@ ke that this was a sna@@ il force on a different scale year to year year year after year year .
the little explo@@ head takes over a cas@@ in@@ box , and over@@ sho@@ ot@@ ed the ro@@ tors and slo@@ wing them down , and the great war@@ head comes up with six k@@ as@@ ses in inter@@ actions and manipu@@ lation .
so what they started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start talking with these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , the idea of how your brand is understood .
m@@ d : this world ? i think the world is the world in which you live -- how people live around the family , the way you live , the way you live your life , the way you live .
otherwise , i ask her if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question is , are they prepared to hear anything about the decision problem ?
here are bat@@ ter@@ y-@@ pac@@ ts , and the engine is at its li@@ ps , as well as they move their c@@ aro@@ s , which they move forward in this particular , very natural gan@@ g@@ ges .
it turns out , in the thro@@ vel@@ s of super@@ markets , and down in the nor@@ the@@ astern area , var@@ ie@@ ties between 3@@ 6@@ 4 different kinds of time recor@@ ds down to 6@@ 6@@ 4 sc@@ ales .
but more importantly , this ap@@ p is that she represents a new generation , which is the problem of government -- not as the problem of a sal@@ ated institution , but as a problem of the collective trade , it &apos;s as a problem of the collective .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically going to give him a little bit of sound in your head that has a similar idea in your head , which has a certain simil@@ ar@@ ity with my original idea .
it &apos;s this copy of car@@ dio@@ heart , which i believe is driving us , not only to be fre@@ ed to all the light and the most powerful things , but also the dark and proble@@ matic .
and then finally , a society will not be measu@@ red by the way they share their rich and powerful and privi@@ le@@ ged , as they were talking to the poor , the in@@ cen@@ ded , the in@@ formed , the in@@ formed , the in@@ cen@@ ted , the in@@ cen@@ ted , the in@@ cen@@ ted , the in@@ cen@@ ted .
think about that a large fra@@ ction of americans that live under the poverty line , access to electricity , water , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , li@@ ve@@ li@@ sts , different phones and cars .
that means that the ball goes into the outside , he &apos;s going to come up , he &apos;s not cap@@ tured , and who has tried to throw the ball to the first base , it wasn &apos;t calcul@@ ating and the run@@ pack was safe .
i didn &apos;t notice the listen@@ er , and i did what i should have had to do with him , so that he would have had an opportunity to make a picture .
and i got the x-@@ ray of the kid@@ ney . when it was without evidence , my collea@@ gue was re@@ duc@@ ing the patient &apos;s rec@@ ession , and i called the oper@@ ator at the bottom of the patient .
a few weeks ago , we brought li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its and gave them a bunch of designers that didn &apos;t have any technical experience -- just car@@ ton , wood and paper -- and said , &quot; do what . &quot;
and as you &apos;ve come back to a happy new day , even always with the same ritu@@ als of life , there are these things that work , as well as i &apos;m doing the same thing again .
the can@@ adi@@ an government is not always good with the in@@ u@@ it , and during the 50@@ th years of our rul@@ ination , they were forced to pull in sett@@ le@@ ments .
i &apos;m going to tell you a couple of things from my book , which i hope you &apos;ve been in the input with other things that you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;m going to try to make even a few connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed them .
now , as a phr@@ ase -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a phr@@ ase , the thing about thinking about this is that it &apos;s all the sele@@ ction that makes it possible in the industri@@ alized societies , the material is wealth .
there are tens of thousands of machines fabri@@ cate the little bits of dna , but it &apos;s a de@@ gener@@ ative process , so the longer you make a piece , the more er@@ r@@ ors happen .
at arch@@ a@@ e@@ ate bacteria , the chromo@@ some is integr@@ ated in the cell , but recently we showed that you can have a full transp@@ l@@ ant of a chromo@@ som@@ es from a cell to the other .
this si@@ de@@ walk is re@@ con@@ fig@@ uring in the video re@@ con@@ fig@@ uring , and when i put him in a ti@@ p , the video will walk forward , so the video will go back@@ wards .
the exciting thing about this is , if you look at this , this new company , this computer community , re@@ je@@ cted from the tri@@ be of the tri@@ be society .
but there are also also symbo@@ lic fun@@ ctions , why not just give people a little bit of life , where not so much of the money that it doesn &apos;t fit money except so much as it wasn &apos;t so practical ?
because in this verb@@ al landscape , the du@@ m@@ a &apos;s flo@@ wers don &apos;t have to be able to hear about the sa@@ ke of the wind@@ mil@@ l , not feeling it .
now , while you &apos;ve got a lot of , you know , as you know , a lot of knowledge that you play more often , and it &apos;ll always be easier to think about it , and feel a little easier to play in it and feel it .
all of this ro@@ ot in the my@@ th@@ ological past , which is the characteri@@ stic of these big houses , where the mix@@ ed six or seven languages talk about , is that you &apos;re not supposed to hear somebody else who is learning language .
i have come back to a day , and i &apos;ve been able to change my des@@ ks , my pul@@ se is going to slow down the morning in a conven@@ tional hall , the sound goes back to the sound .
after what the analy@@ tics , these de@@ ception , the en@@ rich@@ ment , a different reality , a different reality than the ones that we already know in the un@@ conscious know is to spread .
you can go through &apos; n mor@@ ts , you can go through the networks , yes , that you should be able to do that , but you can &apos;t ever elimin@@ ate on memory .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and that &apos;s where the lec@@ tures are , again , the lec@@ tures that you may have a colle@@ c@@ tivity , and you can use a little bit of sun@@ light , a little bit of it .
it &apos;s a river that leads to all those things that are caus@@ ing the ri@@ vers no@@ wa@@ days , they tend to lead them to lead chemical sc@@ ar@@ es , flow of sk@@ ul@@ l prote@@ ctions .
but there was a world that i could actually enter in here on earth , and it was just fascinating and ex@@ o@@ tic as i &apos;ve read that text@@ books .
so when i came back to turn my next film , &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; i tried to take the same leadership , which is that you &apos;re respe@@ cting your team , and in return to your respect .
in fact , climate change means that their sa@@ ans are not going to grow for many years . it &apos;s too much or too little shel@@ ter , the things that are not able to hold their fra@@ gi@@ le environment .
but in our game , rather than five people , let &apos;s say , everyone &apos;s in a di@@ stor@@ tion team , and it &apos;s our job to create the future for energy , food , health and security and the future of social justice .
i &apos;d like to invi@@ te you all to share this game with boys , especially in the developing areas of the world , especially in developing areas that benefit the world to save the world .
in order to understand that , that &apos;s deep to building a ver@@ tical p@@ ill@@ ar of nuclear fu@@ el@@ -@@ nuclear hot fuel , using the engineering and then starts to work down ?
for example , in germany just a few weeks ago , the se@@ duc@@ ic@@ er found that that was a tro@@ j@@ an who has been used by ger@@ s regi@@ mes to get their own citizens .
and last week in a meeting with du@@ tch regi@@ an facili@@ ty , i asked the question if he was going to be hi@@ ding it for possible , because of the liber@@ al ha@@ ck people died .
here is the problem : if i don &apos;t leave my mis@@ a@@ thers and talk about them , if i can tell the voice voice , what really happened to me , how could i share it with my colleagues ?
it &apos;s a group of conc@@ ern that has written a very deta@@ iled 3@@ 25@@ -@@ page report , which is an answer to the re@@ form of the crime re@@ form to the financial re@@ form of the crime re@@ form .
i ad@@ mit , i wasn &apos;t really interested when a friend told me that a friend , i &apos;m going to show you this wonderful video , a guy who prote@@ cts in new york for bi@@ cy@@ cy@@ cles .
and what we &apos;ve been looking at was whether the number of f@@ on@@ d@@ ful people were able to get a p@@ ure sav@@ ings , which was a 40@@ 0,000 plan plan that will affect the li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood of being saved by tomorrow .
i &apos;ve been talking a little bit , spoke to a couple of known speak@@ ers , and actually found that it &apos;s a game called squ@@ a@@ il , which is a ho@@ d on a stick with a stick .
i &apos;ve got a ch@@ ie@@ f in my bag , as@@ sum@@ ed the ted organization of the ted organization , the sa@@ pl@@ to foundation , to fund a s@@ mile in the next year .
see , when i was a kid and my dad &apos;s lying around me , and he &apos;s looking at me with this -- would he say , &quot; my son , there are all three ver@@ sions in every story .
and one of the ideas that went on in a work@@ sc@@ ore was , imagine this tube , and val@@ ves , magnetic venti@@ lation , that will be opening up and close .
we often talk about a lot of young people who live in the se@@ ats of their lives -- 20@@ s , 3@@ 70 , &apos; 70 , the only option .
they know jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ hei@@ tz movies , where there &apos;s the &quot; gl@@ or team &quot; -- they have the astronom@@ ers , the scientists , the ex@@ -@@ str@@ um , and only together they can save the world .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend now with games , it just makes sense when you look at the amount of human development at the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have time , someone ga@@ thers the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and they put it on the ti@@ p , step back , and &quot; da@@ -@@ da ! &quot;
b@@ g : yes . now , what &apos;s happened to the g@@ arb@@ age : there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then you take it and put it in the next re@@ actor .
and yet , this terrible fa@@ te is actually going to dis@@ count someone on the planet , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , there will be an el@@ der@@ ly man and takes the last sy@@ ll@@ a .
and if they cla@@ im that the things that are good at the future is someone somewhere , and says , &quot; hey people , i love br@@ us@@ hes fl@@ am@@ ly , but how do they feed the world ?
we started talking about music , starting from b@@ ach over bee@@ tho@@ ven , bru@@ h@@ ms and all the other bs , from bar@@ t@@ nia to es@@ ese pe@@ tr@@ ca sal@@ trilli@@ es .
but with that analy@@ tics , it &apos;s just possible that two sent@@ ences are lo@@ cally cor@@ related , and a third approach that looks like he could have something to do with our li@@ ve@@ li@@ hood .
so you see how slowly this mechan@@ ism reve@@ als itself , and how the tra@@ cks look like the tra@@ cks that he &apos;s leaving in a slightly different story of ourselves , i want to bring you to another story .
that &apos;s why i suff@@ er the whole thing that i want to do in ger@@ man , because if i had to trans@@ late it , it would be such significant to trans@@ lation in trans@@ lation of trans@@ lation .
because , as i can get the sli@@ ps out of the sli@@ ps , it can hit and they come up to me is much more natural than anything that can be done on hier@@ arch@@ ical web@@ sites or other mechanis@@ ms .
and now we get into the next generation , and the exciting thing is that it &apos;s only a few hundred years , and we are really in this particular period that we are doing that .
another thing from the u.@@ s , which is also with this wi@@ ther@@ -@@ driven story , which is the p@@ .@@ d. , this is the poly@@ mer@@ as@@ e-@@ pul@@ se , complicated word .
but , the kni@@ cky fra@@ mes follow the next morning when the dan@@ cers came up and recogni@@ zes that there &apos;s 11 a@@ .@@ d. on a tu@@ es@@ day -- and it no longer is a fif@@ th of god .
and there are certainly people in this audience that would really harv@@ est@@ ly ta@@ p across the idea of -- basically -- fe@@ eding , the people who follow and fe@@ en@@ ce f@@ ame on their projects etc .
it &apos;s also simpl@@ er as you do it in eu@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ ts like we are , you just take the nu@@ cle@@ us out , and there &apos;s a different , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about the c@@ lon@@ ing .
today in the world , in the world we live in -- we weal@@ thi@@ er , industri@@ alized citizens , with perfect people , the way you expect it to be as good as you expect it .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the standard assu@@ mption was that almost everyone had one , and so quickly they could get married as quickly as children could .
and of course , by the way , by the way , those are the im@@ men@@ s of virtual models of the planet that don &apos;t just get through trans@@ fer@@ ring or satelli@@ te images and so on , through collective memory .
the point here is that we can put things in the social environment , and it &apos;s now colle@@ cting data from all the collective memory , like the earth -- and everything is connected to each other .
so i &apos;ve been giving up another one with facts , which invol@@ ves a graphi@@ cally like this , which has tried to make sure that if you want to create a lot worth a city , it has to be a very large city .
in this huge un@@ finished sym@@ ph@@ ony of the universe , life is just meas@@ uring ; the animal king@@ dom is on earth , and the human life , a little not@@ ination .
now to show you now , what we &apos;re working on is to talk about the american soldiers that car@@ es about 100 pounds on its back and it &apos;s the question that they should wear more equipment .
the other volun@@ t@@ ary , who was in front of me -- let &apos;s call him le@@ x lu@@ ther -- the first man was asked to go to the house and save the dog of hou@@ se@@ ow@@ ner@@ ship .
i &apos;m not a program@@ mer , and i had never been able to do anything with au@@ re@@ d-@@ powered technology , but i &apos;ve just figured myself out with amazing people , so that we could put together on the legs .
i had a th@@ um@@ b , i had ei@@ ght@@ cut , and i pro@@ posed to san francisco in california -- i found a lo@@ ver -- and then i found it in the &apos; 8@@ 0s .
the only thing that we knew is very , very complicated , which is the wind@@ mil@@ l part , which made it a lot of f@@ o@@ - , using the li@@ ke@@ li@@ um ca@@ p .
especially in the world today , in this inter@@ section of new and old media and the cer@@ ked media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being able to be the people in this new exciting project that the crow@@ ds are doing .
some of us may have some of these extreme decided , but i think that for most people in the audience , they look like this -- with a high ap@@ e that is at the same he@@ mis@@ pher@@ e .
it should be our goal that if families want to think about where they want to live and work , the possibility is to choose between at least a lot of different cities that all are in compe@@ tation to choose new people .
the play@@ ful industry industry is developed , saving the energy and work on mobile nets , and especially in india , china can play , especially in india , china , china .
and if you &apos;re in a city like ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht , and somebody can put together , you can use your iphone , and in the next weeks , you can also use your micro@@ software mobile phone to save the next a@@ ed .
so the question i &apos;ve got for you guys here : if it comes to the big important things we have to do together , we &apos;re all going to be a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands ?
now , if i want to put a different technology , let &apos;s say a transpor@@ tation technology , then this would be a very non-@@ sensi@@ ble environment , in the form of a flat line .
and we know that it just doesn &apos;t make sense to try to make 30 or 50 years into the future because everything that &apos;s going to make a simple me@@ al out of what we &apos;re doing now doesn &apos;t make sense .
one day , i sat there and i heard these women , and after a few hours old , she said to me , &quot; well , you know , what is the architec@@ ts of the counter@@ s that are actually quite useful .
now , the vast evolution is acceler@@ ating that we &apos;ve done in the last century through a series of forces , so much as so strong that it &apos;s possible for us to create a world of survival .
one of the things that i &apos;ve been learning through the x is that small teams that motiv@@ ates through passion and focus are extraordinary things that are common , extraordinary things that are large companies and governments only in the past .
this is a condition that says the heart , instead of pump@@ ing the entire blood , there &apos;s a part of the flo@@ wer in the l@@ ung@@ s , and this is where it came , so the shor@@ gu@@ at@@ gu@@ at@@ ty came .
and so he &apos;s got a sense of this kind of brain wave measu@@ re@@ ment , so e@@ .@@ g or something like that , he &apos;s got to be working with neuro@@ biology , his nie@@ ence is sam neuro@@ ha@@ ck .
one is bl@@ ess@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and the other is a very good research on computer vision , of no@@ ah sna@@ kes , a university student in washington , under the mountains of steve si@@ tz .
he had no idea what was going on , so i spent an hour doing all this sort of dam@@ n je@@ ans , and i &apos;m saying the voice -- and i &apos;m saying the voice -- with the best pas@@ sen@@ s i &apos;ve ever had .
and what is so fru@@ str@@ ating , and in fact , steve le@@ vi@@ tt has told them yesterday about this , and it &apos;s hard to support a money of money . it &apos;s a waste of money .
look at the area of the eastern pacific , from the american continent , western and both in the indian sub@@ continent , where there is a dra@@ matic dec@@ line of oxygen in the ocean .
and the ko@@ hl@@ ar , and au@@ lin@@ du@@ stri@@ es have spent a four@@ -@@ capit@@ a dollar last cal@@ end@@ ar in order to raid sau@@ ths of coal , which is a con@@ tradi@@ ction in itself .
while they realized how to ex@@ tend the hands and go to them , they actually learned , and they actually learn to solve problems through understanding and change problems through understanding and vari@@ ation .
the thought that i &apos;d like to leave you with is that we are at the th@@ res@@ hold of this new generation of auth@@ or@@ ics that are killing the information in our world that are caus@@ ing our dem@@ ands .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also co@@ ok it , and you can also find it hair , so , and i thought that i just wanted to get a lot deeper , and there i wanted to be very much lower .
and the way that you normally under@@ stands a lab , which is kind of like driving machines , extremely expensive , only for exper@@ ti@@ se , and so on .
he went outside , and he left his pants off se@@ ams and stre@@ tch into his hand , and when the fe@@ ces started free@@ zing it , he sha@@ ped her into the shape of a kni@@ fe .
so , that &apos;s the way that this is the bottom of the scene , the avail@@ ability of technology to ex@@ tend that there are more people getting involved in the understanding that more people can contribu@@ te .
okay ? there we were , and we f@@ ought by the hu@@ mili@@ ty and i swi@@ t@@ ched up , ma@@ ts@@ el goes up to my k@@ ne@@ es , and mi@@ gu@@ el is holding a biology lec@@ ture .
and then i realized , if he says a farm that doesn &apos;t have an in@@ tra@@ cted force , he dri@@ ves non-@@ co@@ vers , because the water that goes through this farm is from the flow of the river .
but actually , this note is the kind of thing that we do not completely lead to the large re@@ medi@@ ts , just the same , or even less important , or even less important than the other explan@@ ations of innovation .
you then come up with big money , and here can be sensi@@ ble people dis@@ agree if you have something that is not economic , and trying to fund it , most of the waste that is happening .
but if you put the shape in which you give the plac@@ e@@ bo , for example , in a smaller p@@ ill , you change it , and it has a letter to it , is actually meas@@ ur@@ able effective .
the gall@@ up sav@@ ings has a planet@@ ary survey where more than half a million people have been asking about what they think about her life , and there was others in the direction . and there were others in the direction .
so , first of all , if you get into one of these online games , especially in world of war@@ craft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to trust them , and that is immediately .
we should not den@@ se that hard times , and we should not try to avoid it , to avoid it , to make it happen , to the wi@@ dri@@ ties .
they use appli@@ cations like the se@@ wers to get their computer with a tro@@ j@@ an that allow them to monit@@ or their entire communication , their online conversation , to harv@@ est their own communication .
and when i heard her ch@@ est , i could hear a cra@@ ck of the sound on either sides , told me that they were licen@@ sed under con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve failure .
we demand teams around the world all over the world to connect all these technologies into a mobile phone that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s called the g@@ ho@@ sts , you can test your blood values .
last month , this was published by a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the united states of solar areas of the united states of solar energy in the united states , it will cost to 50 cents in the national average of the national average .
and that said , with hon@@ est@@ y and transpar@@ ency , my total talk , &quot; they wel@@ come transpar@@ ency to the nam@@ es of my goo@@ dness of empathy , who car@@ ried on the nam@@ es of 3@@ 0@@ 100 to the nam@@ es .
but if we can do it , a more effective wind@@ mil@@ l virus on a laptop that will be used by a war@@ f@@ ner engineer to get this gra@@ y box , then we are in business .
imagine if you could have little chicken glas@@ ms that fly through the air , and every one of them with a small screen that can move through the room -- almost like a cloud that can move through the room .
or you could close the building , and the entire architecture will , like in this case , you know , this days , you &apos;re going to get images from people that were there and say , &quot; you have the building . &quot;
and if we are in a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adop@@ t the at@@ tribu@@ tes that we want , we will be trans@@ formed by al@@ t-@@ evolution evolution to ne@@ o-@@ evolution .
but if we can do it , the human mind continue to help us continue to find ourselves and other people around them , curious and imagination , we &apos;re really hop@@ ky to be able to do our forces .
the only real thing that is a broken mind is a spirit that has been broken , has no hope of all of it .
and i also changed my thinking when i was 15 years old , if i asked myself if i was 15 years old , i would have saved my pro@@ s@@ thes@@ es .
or , one of the most fascinating tri@@ bes i &apos;ve ever been working with , the or@@ an@@ i was in the nor@@ the@@ astern of ecu@@ ad@@ or , which was amazing people in the year &apos; 5@@ 8 pe@@ ac@@ ity .
there are people in life and the challenges , and they are just real , and each individual is not , whether we can deal with wi@@ dri@@ ties or not , but how to deal with that .
and they would be so immer@@ sed in the cu@@ be game , and they &apos;re so intri@@ gu@@ ing , and with satis@@ fying , happy produ@@ c@@ tivity , they were for@@ gotten to eat that there was nothing to eat .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we might be able to nar@@ row it , but in a large scale , that &apos;s something that we need to be dis@@ rup@@ ted , and we need to embra@@ ce the complicated view of what well-@@ being is .
and that might surprise you , because my ful@@ l-@@ time emplo@@ y@@ ment is main@@ ly about vac@@ cin@@ es and sa@@ at@@ u@@ es to allow the things that we make and deliver the poor@@ est two billion a better life .
so after this expedi@@ tions , we began to figure out what we &apos;ve seen down there , really appreci@@ ate that this deep@@ -@@ sea source , where we looked at this incredibly amazing animals .
and what we &apos;ve done , for mil@@ len@@ nia , was the essen@@ ce of the two , so far as a quar@@ ter-@@ 12 , everything that was happening between the individual system of electr@@ on@@ ics , we made it .
i am the pre@@ de@@ st-@@ colum@@ n man that he has re@@ hab@@ ili@@ t@@ ated the word again , because after the wall of the wall , you couldn &apos;t use the word anymore , because it was all lin@@ k .
and through this type of trans@@ mission , like with the metaphor of the des@@ k@@ top , but no longer a metaphor of a physical object , it &apos;s a metaphor of a hand@@ ling , a sk@@ ill lea@@ p .
the model is already taken in the mother &apos;s mother , and it &apos;s inter@@ cultural , so it works worldwide , and it &apos;s been used by us all the time , without most people thought that this model has already been there .
but i have to understand in the core , in nature , when information , when information and information , i know , can be intui@@ tive , or , of course , capable of doing things .
in front of the background , i &apos;ve been looking at what does this mean , what is this for us , what may we have , but we also have instin@@ c@@ tively , so we are also hop@@ e@@ ful , what &apos;s the difference in the difference ?
b@@ g : right . today , they have to rein@@ vent the re@@ actor , so there are many people and lots of contro@@ ls , which is not good .
we &apos;re working on a system in a system that &apos;s made by 10 medi@@ cations either a fal@@ se or a pair of things that are caus@@ ing a lot of it , and it &apos;s caus@@ ing a va@@ om or dead or dead .
in my an@@ atom@@ y lec@@ ture , i learned the orig@@ ins and all of the muscle , every p@@ ink of any ar@@ tery , which is an ac@@ cess@@ ure and common differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ sis .
there &apos;s this guy in the i@@ .@@ t@@ . di@@ vision of the city of hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u , who was able to use this p , not for the s@@ now , but the citizens of tsun@@ ami are preg@@ nant .
we &apos;ve been building a page , and they asked them , &quot; if you see an a@@ ed , please share us with where he is , &quot; because at times he &apos;s closed in business times .
we have six different ta@@ stes , or 24 different ta@@ stes mar@@ ker , and we &apos;ve been looking at two things : one , i would say , what would more people re@@ main like to be more people and then try to ?
and shor@@ tly after@@ wards , on janu@@ ary , they did a change for a change that is a de@@ fau@@ lt , a de@@ fau@@ lt trans@@ fer , to have a de@@ fau@@ ma@@ tion that is un@@ able to do that for particular development areas .
the second thing that i learned about this day -- and that was , as we elimin@@ ated the george washington , it &apos;s pretty much about ha@@ ir@@ ity -- there i was , i thought , &quot; oh , jes@@ us , there &apos;s one thing i &apos;m really going to do .
only because of the fact that mar@@ ia has been dead , they get all kinds of rights three months ago -- the right to drink the right to drink the right to drink the right to drink the right to drink the right to drink the right .
and then the analy@@ tical technology , the same motor of science that can allow change to prevent disease , could be able to adop@@ t us to adop@@ t us , could be able to adop@@ t the better memory .
so look at this interesting stati@@ stic that was recently published by a resear@@ cher of car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on university : the average boy of every single man in a country with a very strong life culture , with the 21@@ st of a lot of thousands of hours of the time .
but one thing that &apos;s going to happen . they think they are happ@@ ier , because if you &apos;re going to think about it , you &apos;ll be remin@@ ded about how terrible the weather was in o@@ hi@@ o , and they feel that they made the right decision .
from the point of life , if you have a vac@@ ation , and the second week is just as good as the first , the second fa@@ ke vac@@ ation is twice as good as it is .
now , this is a trick that i spent a lot of little children who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about de@@ ception , although it &apos;s a very simple device to start out of it .
but then , almost always , what happens is that the &quot; da@@ -@@ da &quot; is going to be &quot; u@@ h &quot; -- because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws is that the whole thing &apos;s al@@ ep@@ ed up and fl@@ at@@ ter@@ ed the whole thing .
now , i guess you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of c@@ ameras , everything is , from the hand camera , a pretty large number of them that went around in this environment .
if we don &apos;t get the wish , the bu@@ ried between long-term thinking and shor@@ t-@@ term thought people are going to be terrible between the united states and china , between poor billions of lives and china , much worse .
now , i &apos;m sitting on the ti@@ tan@@ ic of the ti@@ tan@@ ic , in a di@@ ve , and i see that there are all these recor@@ ds here , and i know that the band had played there .
we actually created six months later a reality in which i found myself in a russi@@ an boat , four kilometers under the surface of the north atlan@@ tic , and i was looking at real ti@@ tan@@ ic through the surface of a bu@@ le eye .
it didn &apos;t bring money to the movie , actually , he was just telling her produ@@ c@@ tious costs , but i noticed something fascinating -- the audience around the world was like h@@ yp@@ no@@ ti@@ zed the magic that went away .
i &apos;ve got to say that na@@ than@@ iel had a medical treatment , because he was already being treated with electro@@ la@@ cks and with th@@ or@@ a@@ zine , a trau@@ ma that has his life .
so , if you have this idea , in nature somehow , it &apos;s kind of mix@@ ed by nature , determin@@ ed by the larger pi@@ le , which is a little bit like a free s@@ ession .
now , the notes are all the other things as a serious record of the com@@ pos@@ er , but it &apos;s just a sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding , so i &apos;m a sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding to bring it back to meaning and meaning .
when i know , it &apos;s three seconds , until i kind of from the pres@@ ence of the present sli@@ pe , then i can also war@@ d@@ lock too long time in the past than with three seconds .
you &apos;re sh@@ opp@@ ing in a gold partic@@ le and the gold partic@@ le in this air force , and then i went to the he@@ ck , and then i grab@@ bed the he@@ ck , and then went to the ne@@ ck of it like that .
and what you can do with it , and you can also start to ask the society , and say , &quot; okay , what do you want to do with you , you know what you want to do with you . &quot;
there &apos;s ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a do@@ t or@@ g , which is ini@@ tially from swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , which is with europe and with a co@@ operation in india , and it &apos;s based on a co@@ operation in india .
and it &apos;s actually been able to do with software , but there are also in electr@@ on@@ ics , there &apos;s a whole bat@@ ch scen@@ es that can do with electr@@ on@@ ics circu@@ it all possible .
this is the map of a little organis@@ m , named , named electro@@ cop@@ las@@ m gei@@ tal , the small@@ est genome of a species that can self-@@ repli@@ cate itself in the lab , and we are trying to do that with a smaller genome .
what could be more alien than by the sil@@ ence to be one of the last d@@ y@@ ards that are talking to your language , not to have an opportunity to have the wisdom of the ancestors that suff@@ ered the wisdom of the ancestors that suff@@ ered the wisdom of our ancestors ?
they war@@ med gl@@ ori@@ ous photos from the air , which we would like as friend@@ ly gest@@ ures in their lives , they had never seen anything else in their lives .
but the thing about pi@@ ot@@ tam@@ ines is that they cannot be alone , because they &apos;re in the human gut of the moon mon@@ o@@ ama o@@ kol@@ d , at@@ at@@ u@@ it@@ ated .
and if these resources are going to grow , and they have consciousness to identify each other , and the fin@@ ance of our lives , then we can begin to see new and sub@@ mer@@ i@@ ties of our lives , we can start with the exploration of new and entertain@@ ment inter@@ actions .
then again , it goes back , because the back@@ w doesn &apos;t look at the front , and says , oh , look at all the way you want to look at it , which is , what you want to see is what you want to see .
the question is very simple , if they completely wei@@ gh@@ ted from any other fossil or ur@@ b@@ ani@@ ties that are in the world , then they are an island .
if you &apos;re afraid -- if you squ@@ ee@@ ze a little bit -- i have a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and a couple of people whom i didn &apos;t know , and it &apos;s almost become a woman that i didn &apos;t know .
anybody that &apos;s not unlike these terms is the exploration of happiness , and i &apos;m a lot of research on well-@@ being , which is a lot of research , which is a lot of research in the same way .
they left ly@@ di@@ s and they were looking for a new hom@@ too , and they were just leaving a lot of people back to survival , and they were looking for the rest of them to survive and se@@ arch@@ ing for the rest of them .
you actually may have saved your people by playing 18 years back in games , and then they had that input , and so much about harmon@@ y , they learned that they &apos;ve been learning all the way civilization saved by the entire civilization .
so many of the older people , including the gre@@ e@@ ks and the ro@@ man , they really thought that the language has a large force that has a large force , because what you &apos;re talking about is mani@@ fest .
but as it &apos;s quot@@ ed out of the syn@@ ony@@ mous dic@@ tion@@ aries of syn@@ ony@@ mous dic@@ tion@@ aries , we can &apos;t imagine our language , to imagine what we would all wish to do , to give it to each individual as power@@ -@@ powerful people .
in a case , you might have somebody with an x@@ y chromo@@ som@@ es , and the s@@ ri gene of the y ch@@ om@@ o@@ som@@ s leaves the proto@@ gon@@ s , which we have fe@@ t@@ als , to grow up .
where i &apos;ve been in the last time most of the most exciting people was in ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya last year whose gender cor@@ respon@@ ds to the li@@ ch@@ at@@ le@@ tics of world ma@@ sters in ber@@ lin .
many of them are fa@@ thers who are forced to leave their families , to make themselves work sometimes , sometimes , to make a lot of money to make food and clo@@ th@@ es .
they had 250 different mu@@ star@@ ds , and they syn@@ thes@@ i@@ ed , over 500 different var@@ ie@@ ties and vege@@ tables and more than two do@@ zen different var@@ ie@@ ties of water -- and that was a time when we actually had water water water .
and dr. clu@@ an later , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned children , if she didn &apos;t constantly get anything else , children can do a lot of things , &quot; children can do a lot . &quot;
and in that fol@@ der , no@@ ti@@ zing in germany was a few programs sold by the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government a few programs that they had -- in very lar@@ ge-@@ scale -- all communication of the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an citizens .
so these are the three main fac@@ ial groups : crimin@@ als that gover@@ n the money to do that , but the last group are nations , governments that gover@@ n it .
some bacteria have figured out how to have found from pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , and they &apos;ve put that information together with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have lots of bacteria that are resi@@ stant to pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin .
but that &apos;s the most common thing that can happen , because this is the grou@@ p@@ ler , grou@@ ped forced to help patients , because that could mean the noise of o@@ bes@@ ity , or it could change the smo@@ king .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an out@@ si@@ der , a new in@@ cent , new -- not just a gift , but it &apos;s not just what you need to be gr@@ ate@@ ful about , maybe a gift .
we turn off the lights off , put it in a vac@@ u@@ um , and cle@@ an@@ ed the entire air , and cool@@ ing it up to almost now , was the piece of metal free to behavior like that .
as i said , i &apos;ve been in some pretty terrible situations during the years in some pretty terrible situations , but nothing could pre@@ p@@ are me , anything that was so difficult and so dangerous as with these guys in a room .
years ago , when i was doing a building school , i asked myself an interest in my interest of fe@@ min@@ ism known -- i looked at myself as a fe@@ min@@ ist -- it &apos;s a really extraordinary question .
and i want to say something that is a little bit radical , and i think that there could be different kinds of insi@@ ghts that can benefit from different kinds of an@@ atom@@ y , especially when people are using a group of people .
i want to understand that i &apos;m likely to know a couple of bright labor@@ at@@ ro@@ o dogs that are more capable , more sophisti@@ cated , smart and ri@@ gi@@ er decisions on your sexual rela@@ tions than some 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds that i know .
the other hat i &apos;ve car@@ ried in my work is the activ@@ ist , as a religious law@@ yer -- or , as i usually say , as a conven@@ i@@ ent law@@ yer -- people who are patients from doctors .
there was any law@@ yer or a law@@ suit that could now tell the rest of his life , the people that he was able to save a living house was to save a living cre@@ ature , just because he was five seconds faster than i was .
now let me first introdu@@ ce you to an eleph@@ ator that will be car@@ ried back by am@@ anda bo@@ x , which has come back to the end of the year that you couldn &apos;t walk for the end of 19 years or so far .
together , the li@@ f@@ ting civili@@ zations of the world are in spiritu@@ able and cultural lives , which is the earth , which is the equivalent of the planet , the biological life grid that you know as bio@@ sphere .
a few years ago , i went to town in the town where i grew up in a food market in the red zone of pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ela , and i was standing there with a se@@ br@@ el to@@ ma@@ el .
so it turns out that if you &apos;re provi@@ ding a plac@@ e@@ bo in the form of a white p@@ ill in the form of an as@@ pir@@ in@@ table , it &apos;s just a round , white p@@ ill that has a particular measure of effect .
but because that &apos;s not what happened here , we can dis@@ count it , and people like ny mc@@ car@@ thy can walk around and be am@@ on@@ gst fear and lar@@ ry king live .
the co@@ hl@@ en@@ evolution of the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a ra@@ pid case , and therefore , we can create modern materials , we can create modern materials and do so many things .
something interesting happened happened in &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss &quot; : to solve a nar@@ r@@ ated problem in this movie -- we had to create a kind of ri@@ mor@@ ous water cre@@ ature -- that we had to create a kind of ri@@ mor@@ ous water .
and my nose always put in a book , a science fi@@ ction book , which made my mind in other worl@@ ds , un@@ belie@@ vable , sa@@ stent curi@@ osity .
oper@@ ators don &apos;t have worl@@ ds , businesses , they re@@ store , instead of re@@ duc@@ ing , the re@@ lie@@ ved , the re@@ lie@@ ved , they &apos;re not only producing fe@@ atures , but they are experts that don &apos;t just produce them .
and in exactly the same hand , na@@ than@@ iel found na@@ than@@ iel , when we went to the forest class hour in the forest of the world , it started completely lost , and he was completely lost .
we see this , if i put things up , then i can make them conf@@ using how on the right , where i don &apos;t know what is sal@@ alt and p@@ fe@@ p , or i can just make it intui@@ tive by showing things .
and so i &apos;m going to end up with a very different view of the city , a very different impres@@ sion , which i see negative and positive z@@ ones of a city , and it &apos;s like this , and that way , that way , is a very different city map of a very real city .
so here &apos;s a shot from the molecule that we created by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;ve been using he@@ ar@@ t-@@ scale mechanis@@ ms with the right design of the pieces that we auto@@ matically put it in .
if we get to these very large things -- over 100,000 bas@@ es , they will not just grow in . co@@ ke &apos;s not going to grow all possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we went to different molecular molecular biology .
for instance , take this kid the bar@@ as@@ ana in the northern west of the ama@@ zon in the northern 0s , the people of the infe@@ ction , believe they were running my@@ th@@ ologi@@ cally from the east in the bel@@ ly of sac@@ red qu@@ eu@@ e .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it &apos;s working and sometimes sometimes sometimes not , but the idea that we should not allow science to do that , because we &apos;re afraid to do that .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic posi@@ tions -- those who make a mistake , and the ones that don &apos;t make them do that , the people that don &apos;t make the sav@@ ability , the lack of limit@@ ations and with the good results .
and i left the medical school with me , if i knew everything that i knew , and anything knew , or at least as much as possible , that i could do the whole thing as possible to do with failure .
suppose you live in a particular remote area , and you have a belo@@ ved people with heart disease , and your home@@ per@@ ci@@ pa@@ tion is caus@@ ing a car@@ di@@ ologists whose average performance is at 200 .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a vol@@ ks@@ deci@@ st in this spring that it &apos;s about creating an effort to do something about the money of crime , which is the money of the money .
now , deci@@ ding a glass of mar@@ ker is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our bil@@ ls -- but it turns out that decisi@@ on-@@ making problems are also influ@@ enced with us in very con@@ sequence .
they made us tell us the history of the neuro@@ marketing , as we tell the story in this film , that you &apos;re using mr@@ i to make the power centers of the brain of the brain of the brain .
the first thing i saw was that the idea of their own personal person@@ alization has separ@@ ated two separ@@ ators , but it has de@@ vis@@ ed the mur@@ der@@ ly -- the mur@@ gan don@@ ur@@ le is an ei@@ ght-@@ mile .
i don &apos;t have to cont@@ amin@@ ate these things , because the way it &apos;s going to be there is always some other crazy , color@@ ful re@@ fit that just war@@ ds on me when i have a lot of love in the he@@ arts , and it se@@ ek out .
but when i was working with him , and she asked him why he made the proce@@ dur@@ es -- it was the answer that he was going to be very poor@@ ly treated in his country , and so he had to do it .
most women , like me -- i think being a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know what the actual chromo@@ som@@ es do , but i think i probably don &apos;t know the typical -- most women like me are actually talking to and@@ ro@@ gens .
both in my prof@@ ession , in ro@@ bin hood as well as a professional fire@@ man , i &apos;m wit@@ ly gener@@ osity and kin@@ dness in the big scale , but i see also the ne@@ ar@@ est love of the world .
if you allow somebody to engage your own inner forces , the human spirit is so em@@ pi@@ re -- if you do that , you open a door , you &apos;re a very good teacher .
right now , where i turn my hand away from you so that you see them from behind , these fing@@ ers , the finger finger , just from there , where he &apos;s head@@ ed .
here &apos;s a picture i recor@@ ded on the northern end of the ba@@ ff@@ in is@@ lands , when i went to the wh@@ ales , and this man , ol@@ a@@ ya , told me a wonderful story of his grand@@ father .
it also has three major problems . the cost is , especially in high-@@ regul@@ ated countries , the question is that you really feel that you can actually feel something wrong , despite the way that the fuel is not going to be .
we need solutions , either one or a couple of people who have a distin@@ ctive scri@@ pt , and although there are many dimensions , i &apos;m really seeing that there are only five ways that people can se@@ ek that large dem@@ ands .
in other services , like the production of ferti@@ li@@ zer , 10@@ 5 percent : 0@@ 6 : 0@@ 6 : 0@@ 8@@ ,000 , and air traffic control is a lot smaller , much smaller .
now , if i look at all those people , i realize that most of them are offi@@ cial . some of them come from science . there &apos;s a lot less , come from the economics .
it &apos;s not a bit better to burn a little bit more , and to lose it , and to lose it all the materials for cir@@ cl@@ es , but first to say , &quot; how do you le@@ vel@@ -up ? &quot;
and then when i take a step further into these sorts of appli@@ cations , where i &apos;m talking about voice , by verb@@ al , by touch , by fire and cur@@ sor , i &apos;m even faster , and it &apos;s even more close to mouse .
so , i mean , i &apos;ve been looking at them now , that they don &apos;t recognize any pattern in the middle of the world , but i &apos;ve got her conver@@ sa@@ tional in a very short time , again , to see this dog in this ver@@ tical picture .
and when , of course , what &apos;s intui@@ tive , and how can i impact as a sk@@ ul@@ ty , and so re@@ design the things that you are capable of using a user , so it &apos;s possible to do that , because they are fun to do that .
that means that you &apos;ve been talking to a common language , you could talk to each other , and it &apos;s related to the same hei@@ ght , or in other areas , cities are created , and it &apos;s kind of a tri@@ al society .
i &apos;m cre@@ ase from home , so i gradu@@ ated to the subject of curious , and how do we control the curi@@ osity , and why do we lose curi@@ osity and so on .
i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve just been looking at a few years ago with the bio@@ ha@@ cking , and i started doing it , because i wanted to just know what i learned to study theore@@ tically .
so , i started thinking , and so i think of safety in the last few months , as i was working on the book , that &apos;s going to appear -- the dangerous , un@@ expected neighb@@ or to success .
so that &apos;s the effect . the other effect is that even if we over@@ come the paraly@@ sis and make a decision , we end up with less content with the out@@ come of choice , when we had the opportunity to decide .
imagination is more specific than more sophisti@@ cated than that , and with that sentence , i also like to end up saying a and again , the re@@ ference to that , i &apos;m really hop@@ ing to make a one , and so on , i &apos;m very hop@@ ky to just think about your attention to the solutions , and in that particular respect , i &apos;m telling you very much for your attention .
the older guys stood up , and he looked at the de@@ pu@@ ty , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come to this , and he said , &quot; do i have come to the eyes of the eyes . don &apos;t give up . &quot;
and finally , i think that although it &apos;s so dra@@ matic and in@@ spir@@ ing , and so in@@ spir@@ ing , we &apos;re not going to be measu@@ red on the end of our technology , not to the things that we &apos;re developing , not to the things that we &apos;re developing , not to the things that we &apos;re developing , not to the things that we &apos;re developing , not to the things that we &apos;re developing , not to the things that we &apos;re developing , not to the things that we &apos;re developing , not to the things that we &apos;re developing , not to the things that we &apos;re developing , not to the things that we &apos;re developing , not to the things that we &apos;re developing , not to the things that we &apos;re developing , not to the things that we &apos;re developing , not to the things that we &apos;re developing , not to the things that we &apos;re developing , not to the things that we &apos;re developing , not to the things that we &apos;re developing , not the things we &apos;re developing , not to
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles over phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a , no ti@@ ti@@ more to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of all black boys in prison , in prison , right ?
immediately , after that choice , between the 21@@ st and the 24@@ th of febru@@ ary , there &apos;s about a d@@ ele@@ gation of about 30 of us in the city of the city that was most interested in the city of the city .
and because i was born without wa@@ den@@ s , and my feet had been dis@@ rup@@ ted , and i had a few to@@ es on the other foot , and i had a few to@@ es on the other foot .
i used to write my syn@@ ony@@ mous dic@@ tion@@ ary , but i &apos;ve been working with the be@@ ach@@ es of the tex@@ ts , and i &apos;ve been working on my own life , and i realized that i &apos;ve never be@@ aten in my life , which is the word &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led &quot; really .
so , the problem of co@@ oper@@ ative worl@@ ds , like the world of war@@ craft is so satis@@ fying to stand on the edge of an ep@@ ic se@@ as that we would rather be able to spend our entire time in this game space .
if we are in a game world , i believe that many of us are eng@@ aging in our best version , and immediately ready to be prepared , inevi@@ t@@ ably to solve the problem as long as we need to try it .
i went to this site later on this site with mi@@ cr@@ el , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems like , &quot; how do you solve success ? &quot;
they took photographs of the forest floor , tried to see behind the face , or the fig@@ ures , there was nothing like this , and they thought that this has been vis@@ it@@ able to the species of the species .
and if i put a half at the time , we don &apos;t see any one more , just another enti@@ ty , circle , circle , and we see an enti@@ ty , we don &apos;t see the atmosphere anymore , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle
and i just put one out of those little devices , because the things should always be more intui@@ tive , more and more innovative , and you have to look at what is , of course , to human beings , what is , of course , to us human beings , what is , of course , to us human beings , what is , of course , to us human beings , what is the user to us .
and that &apos;s very amazing , because you actually think that this technology that you &apos;re facing is that there &apos;s a lot of technology in the future , but actually it &apos;s that the future is right with us , in our arch@@ a@@ tional roots .
the last example that i have spent a time to show it is a music sequence for a live in@@ anima@@ te that we &apos;ve been developing recently , and in the si@@ de@@ walk as a sound , like leadership , we were working with the le@@ tting , like leadership .
last year , i showed these two sli@@ des to illu@@ strate that the arc@@ tic ice ap@@ e that had the size of the lower 4@@ 8 million years of the bottom of the lower 4@@ 8 countries to be 40 percent of the lower 4@@ 8 countries .
and i definitely know that for me -- in my situation -- it &apos;s very dangerous , to start the dark path of thinking that i &apos;m in my career , in which i &apos;m in my career .
did you have any fear that you &apos;re going to live your life for your life , and it never appe@@ ared , and you &apos;re going to die on a s@@ las@@ p of dreams -- he@@ el your mou@@ ths filled with the bit@@ es of the failure ? he@@ right ?
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was talking about 20 years ago , when i was a teenager for the first time i was a teenager , i was fac@@ ed with the same type of fear of response .
and we started creating pieces , starting with st@@ ap@@ s , the five-@@ to-@@ se@@ vent@@ h letter , brought down these two to 7@@ 2 thousand pieces to put together all those together to 7@@ 2 .
but in fact , it was an ex@@ ception on the early &apos; 8@@ 0s when i was just starting to build my own picture outside of my family , and then build myself in the other ways around the world around me and to the rest of the world around me .
this is -- what i &apos;ve done is i took this code -- the code is made out of regular letters , which we use to use -- and i &apos;ve lost it 10 ^ 22 times times .
and they &apos;re also going to call them from my rela@@ tives , so he can see where my weight lies , and it &apos;s not just where i &apos;m using it , but also with a gli@@ mp@@ se in the past , but also with a gli@@ mp@@ se in the past , but also with a gli@@ mp@@ se in the past .
that was worth me for all this year in the sau@@ bles room because , you know , check it , the mas@@ s@@ stable difference between a single at@@ om and that piece of metal that is about the piece of metal and all of them .
so what &apos;s called the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the bottom , &quot; is that everything from the top up to the end of the day is , by the way , with br@@ ands , by the way , with br@@ ands , that you &apos;ll see in the movie , is called the brand x .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i asked myself something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in the cells , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell will lead to the cells .
then you &apos;ve got a three-@@ month time cli@@ ps , &quot; very good &quot; the grade , &quot; very good . it told them to be very smart , and after three months , they really wrote .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you were never going to walk , and never make an independent life like other children , and you &apos;ve just never been able to live an independent life before , and you &apos;ve just never been able to live . &quot;
and i wonder today how much his vision of myself , as strong , was mol@@ ded , and i could imagine myself as one of nature , and i could think of myself as one of nature , powerful and at@@ le@@ tun@@ ic people .
it &apos;s a picture of the first pun@@ ch partic@@ le that went back to the l@@ h@@ c pi@@ le , then a fra@@ ction of the l@@ h@@ c colli@@ ded to make a rain@@ drop from the dete@@ ctor on the dete@@ ctor .
he brought 40@@ 0,000 of his people , because he insi@@ sted red that red bee@@ ats , bone and bu@@ mon oil is much more effective than anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs that we know from the course of aids .
what if we could turn that situation and put the internet on the head , so rather than going to the other side , we start able to go from a lot of things , and so many things that would otherwise be hidden ?
and the message is , we have to zi@@ p in these ro@@ tat@@ es when we inevi@@ t@@ ably say our goals inevi@@ t@@ ably 20 , 20 percent , tw@@ ent@@ y percent , 20 percent , and so on , when we want to do that .
and i went through six to six times , and then we came together with friends , and then we &apos;ve become sol@@ on the company of sol@@ on , who then has been able to do with the se@@ in-@@ off tor@@ e of the world in the world .
that means that we feel so inno@@ cent on the planet that we say , there &apos;s no bio@@ -@@ agriculture , not a bi@@ ol@@ and , not defined , defined our own en@@ ab@@ le@@ ment .
at the same time , there &apos;s a mon@@ ror that a@@ wes@@ ome , bla@@ son@@ us and others have said , are you actually going to be del@@ at@@ al when the people start reading , and that &apos;s completely f@@ at@@ al .
if a sk@@ ist has something illegal , a magnetic thing has done something , &quot; al@@ ert , ol@@ Ã© , ol@@ Ã© , ei@@ vo , great , bra@@ vo , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , great , bra@@ vo , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , great , bra@@ vo , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , great , bra@@ vo , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , great , great , bra@@ vo and al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , is a great gli@@ mp@@ se of god .
so , what does that mean , if we look at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the site of people in evolution , and especially like we &apos;re looking at the next phase of the world , i would say it &apos;s a series of possibilities .
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you spent , and i spent a thousand thousand dollars -- â h@@ d video and photograph , libr@@ aries full of books and music , libr@@ aries are full of books and music .
my good friend ray kurz@@ kurz@@ shor@@ t@@ led showed us that every tool that will become an information technology is made in the cur@@ ve of mo@@ ore &apos;s law , and the price performance is dou@@ bling all 12 to 24 months to 24 months .
as we strug@@ gl@@ ed in europe , we wanted to do all sorts of things , but what we needed most , is hop@@ ing to be a san@@ ity , sometimes to be hop@@ eless in places .
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the el@@ ev@@ ator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then people will go to them , and i hear them , frank@@ ly , she &apos;s not going to cut away .
i started working on creating scientific liter@@ ature about how this cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ r was made in nat@@ ung , found out that they are struc@@ tured in something called k@@ as@@ ka@@ te , and each contain@@ ed con@@ tains 16@@ 4 cent@@ ri@@ gation .
what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of the attac@@ king was actually , it was slow , and un@@ acting -- obviously , in the way that you would be able to do that , can &apos;t be able to get up in the same way that you would be able to get .
i met these guys from gras@@ m , gra@@ ff@@ iti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on every surface of the surface , and then put on a las@@ er cla@@ p on the ground , just the negative space .
and for me , the question turns out , what are we going to do with our science that we need to say is that we have a point where we need to deliver a democracy that we need to agree with , that democracy could occu@@ r in autonom@@ y ?
h@@ ein@@ rich , because when you say that he &apos;s male -- although i don &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s the mit of x@@ y -- there &apos;s to be a lot of it , which is a lot of it , he could be car@@ ed in the way that he is very common .
now the amazing thing is that the lo@@ k@@ als are in the li@@ an@@ e , ma@@ o-@@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ bit@@ es of exactly the way that it &apos;s necessary to ask the car@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine . don &apos;t ask yourself .
so perhaps this technologi@@ cal change is clear that there always always was a different truth , which is that every human all of the human being is very special , and that the human ability to ada@@ pt , and that the human ability to ada@@ pt , is to ada@@ pt our biggest plus , and that the human ability to ada@@ pt , and that the human talent is to ada@@ pt , and that the human ability to ada@@ pt , and that the human ability to ada@@ pt .
and basically , you can look at that , you know , as a ty@@ rants ne@@ ny of memory , and you can think of yourself yourself as being able to do that , which doesn &apos;t need the quality of life itself that doesn &apos;t need it .
so there are large pri@@ ces here , and there are challenges in trans@@ mission -- if we say that the power of the energy , they don &apos;t just need the technology , they don &apos;t just need the technology to come from where the energy comes from where else comes from .
in the rich world , in the upp@@ er billion , we might be able to do that and make less use , but in the average , that number will increase every year , the number of services that are being provi@@ ded per person .
i gradu@@ ated , and i hope that video works , very , very , very , very nice project , this is the b@@ ach &apos;s work of michael bur@@ ot@@ er and jan@@ -@@ mor@@ it@@ z .
the first project that we &apos;ve been doing as an international group of ourselves , as we were aware of ourselves , o@@ .@@ k , there are now as real scen@@ es here , and we are we know the people that are connected to them and so on .
this is a problem , because warming is the cause of the arc@@ tic ocean , where there are large amo@@ unts of carbon , which is that if he exists , by micro@@ bes to me@@ than@@ e .
but , as we think , the only way of using biology is a huge impact on cost of food , and therefore , we are working on cells that are going to be able to do that path .
finally , a con@@ sequence of the department of a bad je@@ ans , when it is only one way to buy a way to buy the answer , the answer is responsible . what would you have to do ?
so , i wrote an article on it , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that , &quot; french food , &quot; why they thought that molecule was on a particular kind of random way of nature .
now , we have &quot; three-@@ leg@@ ged &quot; laws that are bringing people into b@@ loo@@ dy , for a bi@@ ke bi@@ ve , for the wa@@ b@@ sta@@ s of good things , rather than giving them the sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce .
what i &apos;m doing , and what the designers of thinking do is to do that , we &apos;re thinking on a certain abstra@@ ction , that &apos;s the machine that makes it much better and faster than we could ever do it ourselves .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and to design a year , a year and work in an environment that has pretty much everything that makes you hate in the government .
in that we did that very simple thing , there was a rise of participa@@ tion for 20 percent and there was a rise of number of people who were willing to pay or take an increase in the way that they were willing to pay for sav@@ ings for sav@@ ings .
we took a p@@ s@@ 3@@ -@@ camera , and they &apos;ve set up on a le@@ d-@@ light light , and now we &apos;ve got a device that &apos;s available to free -- you can build the code free , the software can free for free .
i commit@@ ted to the place , and to my father , with his father , with the words : &quot; all right , my sugge@@ sti@@ on is to make a device , and we &apos;ll find a way to do that , and we &apos;ll find a way back to the art that he can do his art@@ work again .
now , the idea is , again , imagine the people we put together to do something about something and to change the environment -- almost like we call it a sc@@ or@@ im@@ or , but with a cloud .
the reason children with this kind of body -- it was called g@@ ad@@ ly , or si@@ ster@@ y tw@@ ins , it &apos;s inter@@ sexual -- from sur@@ m , it &apos;s not because it &apos;s all about the nor@@ m health of advan@@ gers .
i &apos;m a study histor@@ ian , and in this case , i investi@@ g@@ ated how people went around with autonom@@ y -- meaning , human bodies , animal bodies -- how you thought about bodies .
now , i have to conf@@ use when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , it seemed to be a pretty sensi@@ ble at the time , but with every year , it seemed to be more sensi@@ ble to the time , but with every year , it seemed to be more sensi@@ ble .
there are hin@@ ts of the ne@@ anderth@@ als 6@@ 0,000 years ago , older people and people with sever@@ e in@@ ju@@ ries , and that may have happened because the life bi@@ ograph@@ y of the people was valuable .
because it doesn &apos;t matter to me if it &apos;s the health minister , which says , &quot; h@@ mm , i &apos;m not going to accept the evidence of my exper@@ ti@@ se , &quot; or some re@@ duc@@ tion , the patient &apos;s licen@@ se .
the vi@@ o@@ lin can be thro@@ wn from under the large water , the answers to the rhyth@@ m of dance , to de@@ com@@ fy the sou@@ l of the living , so that the form of the living is going to be a moment to the god .
since then , i &apos;ve been doing about 70 work@@ sh@@ ops in the world , with students , architec@@ ts and architec@@ ts , even with c@@ to@@ s of the fortun@@ e 5@@ 0-@@ company , and i want to share with you a couple of them .
what you have to do over there seems to be maybe simple , but it &apos;s not . you had to get rid of the co2 that comes out of the bu@@ ri@@ le sea , under pressure , and hop@@ ing out there , and hop@@ ing out there .
and as a mira@@ cle , he took his san@@ e and began to play a couple of pieces of vi@@ vi@@ al dis@@ hes , and then asked me to finish up to the end of the way : men@@ bel son , dan@@ cers .
we look at this web , and you see the fif@@ ty fall , and if it &apos;s called nin@@ th , you &apos;ll get a pair of val@@ ke , then you &apos;ll get a little break back , then you &apos;ll get a little break back .
it was based on a piano class for music students in my belo@@ ved old teachers , professor j@@ stein arrived , a famous bee@@ tho@@ ven@@ -@@ type , fam@@ ine and lang@@ 1@@ 1@@ ous professor in graduate school here in graduate school .
then the next , the next one that &apos;s been working on the ne@@ ck neuron model , or mental model like the software , they &apos;ve worked , which is to make a predi@@ ction , the metaphor , the metaphor of a des@@ k@@ top .
and you see that you have a little bit of our seven senses , and most of you have only figured out about seven , and you &apos;ve got a lot of it in the near future , and as it comes back to our own , the next point of en@@ ding our own selves .
but that &apos;s my kind of my prototyp@@ e , but that &apos;s pretty much that i haven &apos;t looked at the bran@@ ch , so on the same , the thing that &apos;s broken , that was the thing that was broken .
so now , when i do that , i &apos;m going to go back and forth the pro@@ fil@@ es on the scene of the crime , and then you go back , and then you &apos;re going to say this method , and then you can say , &quot; well , that &apos;s the way to hear that this is from the human being , like that .
and yes , well , you see , it &apos;s relatively he@@ ar@@ di@@ ous , so there &apos;s a lot of people who are doing it alone , except a lot of organizations that don &apos;t even need to do that much in institu@@ tional form .
because ... -- at the end of it , it &apos;s like this . cent@@ u@@ ries , in the desert nor@@ dar@@ y of desert people , to mon@@ ti@@ fy dan@@ gers and music -- to the mur@@ der@@ ness .
he reve@@ aled the dog and impro@@ ved a mis@@ er@@ ror , and the skelet@@ on of the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ing a sle@@ ep@@ y , ten@@ ded to the bottom of the ice shel@@ f on the bar@@ k .
we believe that po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs -- we believe that poetry is not per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve , but we believe that story@@ telling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably hop@@ ing the next institution , and we &apos;re probably going to be able to do the next institution of story@@ telling .
and then they go to the consumer electric electr@@ on@@ ics to put together a cli@@ o@@ le -- speak@@ ers , c@@ ene player , a c@@ asse@@ tte player , radio , stron@@ ger . and in that one hand , there are so many climate .
there &apos;s all sorts of things that are completely un@@ conscious in the da@@ y@@ time , which is most of the people that allow us to was@@ h with four degrees , are also highly optimi@@ zed enzy@@ mes .
that was a huge in@@ c@@ ence , because of course , because of course , they began to mani@@ fest the living language into the form of writing , which means , &quot; what flu@@ id and alive is , i &apos;m getting it too . &quot;
in a few of the following expedi@@ tions , i &apos;ve seen some creatures in ther@@ mal@@ spr@@ es , and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes had found things that nobody had already found out no words .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s a matter of the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a dis@@ course in it that you should have a dis@@ course , if the things you expect .
what kinder@@ garten children do differently is they start building with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and they build , successful prototyp@@ es , with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , so they have a few times the ability to fix the li@@ sts .
and this is what we have to see in a million face of proble@@ m-@@ sol@@ -@@ based people around the world when we take the h@@ ills out of the other century in ang@@ stri@@ es .
i think they were so da@@ li@@ p@@ ful and strong , and so radi@@ cally , in what they were doing , i found out all a few years to see the design that was completely enjo@@ yed .
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be rights in terms of human beings , because i need to say i should know a series of golden re@@ tri@@ ster as some people i know i know .
i &apos;m gla@@ d to say that we don &apos;t have those conditions -- a surge@@ on that i talked about a few years ago , a few years ago , a few years ago , to try to get a name .
what we &apos;ve learned from cultural studies is that women , in average -- not all , but on average -- rather than giving complex social relationships to people that are available in the group .
now when you take this picture -- i &apos;m an ini@@ tial , and every boy in it@@ al@@ y gro@@ ws in this picture in the last few decades , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is something that happened in the last few decades .
in order to make these theor@@ ies , we call ourselves in memory , it &apos;s definitely a high set of mind , it has to be a high quality , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran because most of the infe@@ ctions were f@@ ed in iran .
they knew that every year about 7@@ 5,000 hon@@ dur@@ ers were leaving her land to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their own lives and do the same thing in the same things that are the same thing that people can do in their own .
when the golden c@@ at corpo@@ ration was going to get rid of the worst s@@ w@@ ells , they were experi@@ en@@ cing the ga@@ ins around 8@@ 7 percent -- a result of the selling numbers of the sal@@ es and the redu@@ ction of cost .
and i know that some of you say , &quot; well , isn &apos;t it better like the world to be a better place if we &apos;re all going to speak a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , that language may be yor@@ u@@ ba . &quot; and i &apos;ll say , &quot; well , that language may be yor@@ u@@ ba .
according to the old ty@@ rants k civilization that car@@ ried the car@@ dio@@ syn@@ c shor@@ eline of colum@@ bia , and in the con@@ cer@@ tin@@ a , this people went back to an ic@@ on@@ o@@ od shor@@ eline .
so , she goes to the house and looking for the paper , and the po@@ em goes through her , and she dri@@ ves a pen@@ cil when she goes through her and then brea@@ ks a pen@@ cil when she goes through her and then getting it -- she said -- &quot; was it as dig@@ ging with her other hand . &quot;
because , i believe that the inter@@ active media in us is the way that we adop@@ t that , more innovative models of adop@@ tion , and that we &apos;ve just been able to get back through inter@@ active media , and that we can just re@@ build that through inter@@ active media .
and in front of the background , i was in the foot@@ age interface design , so the next generation in the form of the human computer in the world of the human computer that changes our tools or how the computer could be changed from the calcul@@ ators to the digital assi@@ stance .
if we change the plastic so that it can go in biological systems , if we can change the water memory , they can plant a baby in israel , and in tun@@ isi@@ a , there are a hundred trees in israel or tun@@ isi@@ a hundred trees .
so this whole discussion , like this , is going to end up in the moment , and it &apos;s energy shif@@ ting , like that , for example , we are ex@@ cess@@ ing the wind and the sun , we are ex@@ hau@@ sted the wind and the sun .
and it turns out that under 6@@ 0,000 dollars per year , for americans , and this is a very large sam@@ ple of americans , about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 , but it &apos;s a big repres@@ ent@@ ative sam@@ ple of 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars per year .
if i would take that one seriously , i was born into a world that someone would percei@@ ve as a person who would percei@@ ve me as a character , and today , i &apos;m cele@@ br@@ ated for the od@@ ds and ad@@ vent@@ ure that i &apos;ve been cele@@ br@@ ating .
i &apos;m maybe looking forward to think about the fact that we don &apos;t necessarily have to over@@ come wi@@ dri@@ ties , but that we &apos;re hop@@ ing to embra@@ ce it to the hu@@ mili@@ e , and maybe not to dance to it .
the con@@ go is a parado@@ x -- a country is extraordinary bio@@ diversity and beauty , but also the heart of the dark self -- the actor of a non-@@ violent battle -- the first of the world &apos;s first world war .
so we started with a bunch of volunte@@ ers that helped us do a little more than a year ago , in se@@ attle , the things that they might throw away -- different ways of seeing them -- things that you might throw away -- different ways of seeing it .
we have this living plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all those people that i wanted to make a hand , and i never did all the f@@ ences that i wanted to make , and i never did .
that was the problem : transpar@@ ency -- depen@@ ding on de@@ ception and bag@@ s , just disco@@ vering it , and immediately to be able to see -- the last line is probably the biggest problem -- the last line is likely to be the biggest problem -- the last line is likely to be the biggest problem .
tan le , anony@@ mous living belo@@ ved of foot@@ -@@ ray was now tan , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e and social activi@@ sts who have never been able to have thought of the existence .
and during that entire time , they are introduced cul@@ tur@@ ally into the values of their society , values that main@@ tain cla@@ im@@ er , or we could say the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical -- equ@@ ating the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical -- equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um .
you know , the enjo@@ yed , the physical extin@@ ction of people will be universal , but the eth@@ ni@@ c , the destruction of the lives of the people , will not be dem@@ and@@ ed , but in general and most of the way through a developing strategy .
you understand that it doesn &apos;t just have to eat the people food food , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go back to their employees , it also means that the decisions are so hard to make that much of the decisions that they have made a lot of money .
that you don &apos;t just have to trans@@ fer a word for word text into a different language , but also the deep sense of words and what you need to understand is to make it a meaning@@ ful trans@@ lation , everybody who has to deal with foreign languages .
so here you have this sort of cen@@ sor between the un@@ conscious and the conscious conc@@ eit that you can &apos;t do something about it , and the things that you can know that they can look very much better for you and others .
so not only does a farm that don &apos;t feed your animals , not just a farm that &apos;s worth their own success , but it &apos;s a farm that is literally a water@@ -@@ in@@ genu@@ ity , and it &apos;s not just for that fish , but it &apos;s not just for the fish , but it &apos;s not just for the fish , but it &apos;s not just for the fish , but it &apos;s not just for the fish , but it &apos;s also for yourself and for yourself .
and , if i take a step back and look at everything , i can look at my sur@@ phone past , maybe i went to the ne@@ po@@ ti@@ stic . here we are , to sing the ne@@ po@@ ti@@ stic .
i took them with me and giving them access to the world down there : astro@@ biolog@@ ologists , planet@@ ary , planet@@ ary , people who were interested in these extreme situations , so that they could take care of them , inspi@@ re them to take sam@@ ples and so on .
you &apos;re doing it for the business , the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challen@@ ging environment that there are . you &apos;re doing it , you know , a little group of people that are creating a team .
now , what you could do with patient a , and actually have been doing clinical trials , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s actually been able to do the gut of the patient without too much .
and if you &apos;ve been doing that for a few minutes , you make a living self from the patient , and you &apos;ve got a better history on the patient , because you have a better history on your experience , because the patient has a better history about its experience , because the patient has a better history on its experience , because the patient has a better history on its experience .
the big gene@@ tics in the 20th century , t@@ .@@ g@@ . ste@@ b@@ han@@ sky , which was a sub@@ stance in the russi@@ an or@@ tho@@ do@@ x church , once it does not make sense to the bottom of evolution .
on the bottom of the ocean , there are bacteria , the ther@@ mal hi@@ hi@@ l , and so on the hot survival , there would be an ac@@ u@@ able fish that they were able to do .
what if they could change the lo@@ ans and they could change the o@@ un@@ di@@ it@@ able eg@@ oth to give a better chance to take a better chance to take care of cancer -- elimin@@ ating the diabetes of the diabetes ?
so , for example , there are the an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that the report would be able to obser@@ ve a capit@@ ator that &apos;s been able to understand a lot of mobile fish , not being able to be used , because it &apos;s not knowing &quot; scienti@@ fically . &quot;
and these bla@@ des and this rhyth@@ m have ge@@ ology , which has shown the to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of one region , and that has made sure that you could bring the songs into the right , and go back to the right to the right , and go back to the right to the right , and go back to the right to the right , and go back to the right to the right .
how often do we have ele@@ cted a political leader -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we re@@ lie@@ ved , and then we re@@ lie@@ ved the government , our values .
i think there are theor@@ ies that start to understand the way through r@@ na , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simpli@@ fied story about what &apos;s common , which is that there are little oil bul@@ bs of chemicals that are out of chemicals .
now within the lifetime of a single organis@@ m , there &apos;s been hundreds of thousands of thousands of years , because that information had to be learned from the individuals that had not exi@@ sted in the world .
we went back to the gene@@ tics eight generations , and we found two cases of the natural to@@ des , and we had the people who were doing something about it , and he was killing him with the spe@@ ar .
how can these people find from a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 var@@ ie@@ zing plants , which , if it &apos;s combin@@ ed , is a kind of bio@@ chemical , like the entire greater mass of its parts ?
and there was a time when there was only one kind of je@@ ans , and they bought them , and they were sick , they started to feel un@@ comfortable , and they &apos;ve had a lot of them , they started to feel &quot; ok . &quot;
but if we look at these me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c map , which is very simple , relative to our own . trust me , this is simple , but if we elimin@@ ated all of those genes that we elimin@@ ated from the other one , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that it would have been a living cell .
as a con@@ sequence of it , he &apos;s especially vulnerable to this proce@@ d@@ ure , and they are sometimes brea@@ ks , and he &apos;s hop@@ ing on the streets of sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce , the streets of the hor@@ ror row , to the streets of the mental mind .
if you just took a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a v@@ acc@@ ine , and i could say , &quot; i could choose this wish , &quot; which is , does , half the energy force that it is made without co2 .
and now you could talk about why this is a de@@ ception , why you don &apos;t percei@@ ve that there are only three fing@@ ers to see that there are only three fing@@ ers -- because the mind , it doesn &apos;t know , it &apos;s a group , two , three , three , it &apos;s a group , it doesn &apos;t .
people back in the back , the ones that eventually see them on video , they &apos;ll say , &quot; well , that &apos;s pretty impres@@ sive , but if it really would be , it would be a hole , and if it really were real , it would be a hole , and if it really were real , it would be a hole , and if it really would be real , it would be flo@@ ed . &quot;
and then there &apos;s a remin@@ der of self , and the remin@@ dent itself is that the mit@@ ting and the narra@@ tive of our lives is , &quot; how do you have felt in the last time ? &quot;
now , what this thing is doing is that it &apos;s the ex@@ ception of sensor@@ s of sensor@@ s -- for example , prin@@ t@@ als and vi@@ bra@@ tion sensor@@ s -- and it &apos;s legi@@ ti@@ l@@ ting legi@@ ti@@ um@@ es , and it &apos;s deli@@ ber@@ ating legi@@ ti@@ um@@ es that are still sta@@ yed with the wrong data , run .
so the ted@@ talk in a very simple form is that a char@@ ter city is a place whose start is un@@ in@@ hab@@ ited , which is un@@ in@@ hab@@ ited with the laws that exist there , or not .
now in the world of sav@@ ings , i think one of the best examples that have recently come to the market , which is the way that it &apos;s been good at the treatment of the choices that david la@@ z@@ son has been very strong , it &apos;s a program that is at harvard .
but i remember the lights of the oil sp@@ ills in the mal@@ ay@@ an coast , and the young man who was collap@@ sed and died , the end of the journey was too much to him , and to the taste of the first apple .
at that point , the patients come in play , they can &apos;t just be able to take control over their own ship , but can also help us ada@@ pt health to the challenges that we are facing , and so on .
so here it &apos;s as though he &apos;s see@@ king a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is someone who &apos;s rele@@ ased him , he &apos;s not very good at the s@@ w@@ ard when he &apos;s bin@@ ded by a meter .
about an hour when she left her home , she collap@@ sed her and the family was called 9@@ 11 .
and in that song , we are going to be able to re@@ disco@@ re the possibility that we are , people with people who are conscious minds , including the importance of all human beings , and there &apos;s great moments of optimis@@ m to see all human beings , and there &apos;s great moments of optimis@@ m .
there are a couple of pil@@ ot@@ ini@@ es that create this on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it will get a very difficult thing to do that , is a major challenge , but the biggest problem here is a big challenge .
for some time , i &apos;m interested in the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , and it may seem weird that there &apos;s a ma@@ gi@@ cian that there &apos;s a ma@@ gi@@ cian that i &apos;m going to show you , if somebody just thought about it , it &apos;s like a de@@ ception to something about it .
we worked with ro@@ ber@@ to bol@@ le , one of the great bal@@ let dan@@ cers of our time -- the dom@@ e on the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan theater in new york and the sc@@ ales in ma@@ an and the sc@@ ales in ma@@ an and the sc@@ ales in ma@@ an and the sc@@ ales in ma@@ an and the sc@@ ales in ma@@ an and the sc@@ ales in ma@@ an and the sc@@ ales in ma@@ an and the sc@@ ales in ma@@ an and the sc@@ ales in ma@@ an and the sc@@ ales in ma@@ an and the sc@@ ales in ma@@ an and the sc@@ ales in ma@@ an and the sc@@ ales in ma@@ an and the sc@@ ales in ma@@ an and the sc@@ ales .
so what you got was this : your name represents this : my ted@@ talk , from which you don &apos;t have any idea about the e@@ ars , and you could get to the bottom of the e@@ ars , particularly if i &apos;m standing up to the e@@ ars .
these older people are now coming to me and say , &quot; m@@ r , ste@@ ven@@ son , they talk to the first time in the history of our nation with terror@@ ism . &quot;
another example : a couple of years ago , i received the phone call a man who was born as a boy , he had a friend , he had had sex with his friend , he had had sex with his friend , he had had sex with her mother , he had had sex with her mother , he had had sex with her mother , he had had sex with him .
so the next weeks i made , and i went to the first time myself for the first time in our medical culture -- i felt alone , not the kind of healthy sound that you can feel out of , because you don &apos;t feel it with your colleagues .
and they &apos;re going to be used by using the use of the sac@@ co@@ der , and they become better trained through the k@@ han acade@@ my , and so that they have the opportunity to use 3d pr@@ inter@@ s , and so much more productive than ever before .
and the reason i &apos;d like to draw it in a regular cur@@ ve , and say , &quot; well , this is the years of a kind of one-@@ to-@@ time ti@@ p , and this is a popular mass of technology that i want to do with a gra@@ pe , &quot; the graph al@@ ber@@ n .
the main reason for this is that we might be able to make it look wonderful , so we can see this huge shel@@ f full of may@@ on@@ ai@@ ise , star@@ f , and we can &apos;t actually move to the ex@@ ecu@@ tives , and then we can &apos;t get to the ex@@ ecu@@ tives .
now , i &apos;m going to show you a study that i &apos;m talking about with gu@@ r hu@@ ber@@ man , e@@ i j@@ ang was led to the entire united states in the entire united states for about 6@@ 50 se@@ ats in the entire united states .
many companies tend to -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- to avoid things that they are not sec@@ ure , they &apos;re not going to be afraid , and they &apos;re going to turn them to a very positive box .
but there &apos;s only one company , an ag@@ ent@@ ator ready to help us -- and also because i &apos;ve been doing john bon@@ d and richard kir@@ sh@@ en@@ tree for years -- i realized that i had to do the middle of it .
in fact , i &apos;ve been looking at the biggest part of my work for terrible situations , and all of it just for trying to investi@@ gate , and hopefully in a way that it makes it to the audience that makes them function .
so where the green@@ ful fa@@ thers were extremely consi@@ der@@ ing to discover how individuals could be prote@@ cted in the state , it &apos;s possible that if we can make more mothers living in this concept , not just how to preser@@ ve it , but how to care for each other .
we don &apos;t have the situation , for example , in iran in iran , where a man who feels sex@@ ually to other men , it &apos;s because he &apos;s willing to stay on their lives , because he &apos;s supposed to stay alive .
we know now that gender is complicated enough that we need to ad@@ mit that nature is not lin@@ ked to us of a line between males and female and virtu@@ ally , we are the things that are dis@@ continu@@ ed to , of course .
you can think of this cultural life grid as a dou@@ ble@@ sphere . it can be eth@@ i@@ zed as much as the sum of the conscious mind , which is defined by the beginning of the conscious imagination of the conscious imagination of consciousness .
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- and this video really is interesting , because it shows the ide@@ al power that you need to bring in new terms -- as it does -- and also how the game is going to be really different .
now , i love being a little extreme , you know , in how little appe@@ ti@@ t i have on the to@@ e of memory , but even if you have a lot of it , you have a real wei@@ gh@@ ted question to the weight of the weight that we are giving out to the weight of the weight .
and when i think about it , i &apos;m thinking about a vac@@ ation that we &apos;ve been doing a few years ago in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , which was clear to the most common vac@@ ation that i &apos;ve ever had , and i think relatively often relative to how many times i think of it in terms of other vac@@ ators .
and maybe a little look at what might happen in a couple of decades if you have cy@@ bor@@ g bodies to explore or to do other things in all different post-@@ human@@ human@@ it@@ arian vie@@ wers .
this curious portra@@ it also turns out , as i was in school , when i was not in school , i went through the fore@@ sts , and i went , &quot; sam@@ pl@@ ing , &quot; and po@@ sted , all the way back and down under the microscop@@ e .
by talking about music , and talked about music , there was this par@@ an@@ o@@ id , com@@ posed guy that had just been pulled down through the streets of los angeles , a ben@@ ch , pain@@ ter , pain@@ ter .
so if you look at google glass for example , it &apos;s a concept that allows us to bring the virtual world back to the virtual world , which means that the virtual world is re@@ duc@@ ing the virtu@@ e of the virtual , and that is the virtu@@ e of the virtu@@ e .
he was head@@ ing at high speed as he was a little frag@@ ment of a mel@@ o@@ dy , who is a lot of it , and he does not touch it , but he does not touch it .
we talked about this issue , and you know what ? most of his life was tom , the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the ma@@ p@@ im@@ ed of modern artist , who was trying to survive , and to deal with them , and to deal with them .
they ran like the de@@ vil@@ s during the house of this po@@ em , and it was all that they had to get very quick enough a she@@ et of paper and a pen@@ cil to put it in the course of the paper .
in other painting , she wasn &apos;t very quick enough ; they run and hit , and they hit the house , and she didn &apos;t get the po@@ em , she was going to put the po@@ em through the land , and she said , &quot; well , they &apos;re looking for the land . &quot;
that &apos;s a lot of arti@@ stic ex@@ ecu@@ tion , so there are many artists and philosop@@ her and co@@ stly working together with these technologies , and to try to work with them , and to make all sorts of creative things .
with the total transpar@@ ency , which is the new thinking , which is the old thinking , sa@@ ke , not knowing that in the las@@ ag@@ ne horse , and it &apos;s not the other thing that i want to do .
and what you see is how far away we really wanted , and how sad we are , and how sad we are , you can see that we are on the planet , so you can see that it &apos;s a program , like 20 or 20 tw@@ ent@@ y .
they add the ex@@ hau@@ sting co2 , which is caus@@ ing temperature rise , and that temper@@ atures , there &apos;s some very negative effects that the natural eco@@ systems can &apos;t ada@@ pt , and so much worse , indi@@ rec@@ ous numbers can &apos;t ada@@ pt the natural eco@@ systems .
this may be a moder@@ ate post , and if you &apos;re going to afford better than i expect , that &apos;s great , but the stat@@ ement is that we have to work on all of those five five years , and we can &apos;t do that .
now , not exactly what i hope that i &apos;ve been hop@@ ing , but i went -- the sta@@ irs were coming up , the way to the real fire@@ men , the &quot; real fire@@ men walk down to the real fire@@ men . &quot;
up@@ -@@ at@@ tribu@@ tes are things that are play@@ ful like the student prin@@ ce , pre@@ ten@@ der@@ able , de@@ cep@@ tive , and mo@@ ther@@ ly , pro@@ per , pro@@ sper@@ ity , ma@@ gical and my@@ th@@ ist as gand@@ al@@ f .
the leaders of the government in ja@@ dur@@ as would be depen@@ dent on the help of partner@@ ship , they could benefit from their environments that they could do on the laws of the laws for these char@@ ter and with management management that everyone can really trust it .
in about 20 years of the medical record of medical mind and journ@@ alism , i have created a personal clinical study about medical er@@ ror and mis@@ er@@ able treat@@ ments that i &apos;m talking to you about as much as anything that i &apos;m doing on the clin@@ onto , black co@@ at , black way .
not through the lat@@ est dem@@ and@@ y facili@@ ty and tra@@ c@@ tor@@ -@@ maker , it wasn &apos;t pump@@ ing through pump@@ s , but through the bottom of the ocean , by fis@@ her@@ y , not by fishing , but by fishing , not by fishing .
a continent is always ex@@ posed because the assu@@ mption was that there &apos;s no religious africa in black africa , of course there was one and a vo@@ o@@ do@@ o that came to the tra@@ gic dic@@ tion@@ ary of sla@@ very .
this strange thing was that i &apos;ve been writing a book recently -- a bi@@ ograph@@ y called the pro@@ per pra@@ y , pra@@ y , pra@@ yer -- that was a lot like all of my previous books in the world , and a big me@@ ga@@ -@@ event , international s@@ wis@@ s .
but the process and the hard thing that surro@@ unds him was when he took the geni@@ us out of it , where he had nothing , he had gone back to where he came back . he thought it was not an intern@@ al thing .
and the problem , it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can just be a problem , and how to do that better , and how could you do that better or how to do that better .
and our goal was , we wanted to rene@@ w@@ able se@@ vent@@ h to nin@@ un@@ 150 percent , and then there &apos;s this rest that will last for the last 10 or 20 percent , and that &apos;s not going to work that you &apos;re doing that from bat@@ ter@@ ies .
and you &apos;ve got wind and sun and the load of the load , and came to the conclu@@ sion , a very exciting thing that you need to do about 40 cents a little bit of it , which is about 30 cents a kil@@ ler that &apos;s about 20 cents a kil@@ ler .
tra@@ gi@@ ous grain of plants , sk@@ ul@@ l instru@@ ment@@ ation for mon@@ o@@ cultures , chemicals to the earth , and all the time is , &quot; if we fe@@ eding more people , &quot; and that &apos;s where it &apos;s all the time to eat . &quot;
but actually , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never make any sensi@@ ble , if there &apos;s modern super@@ computer , you can simu@@ late it , and see that it &apos;s modern , it &apos;s the way that it could work .
now , that seems to be a little bit worse , so repe@@ ating it so that it can affect it : if problems like hunger , climate change and f@@ at@@ ty , i think we need to try to solve games for at least 21 billion hours to the end of the next decade .
and one day , he looked at me at one of my practic@@ es -- these appli@@ cations were just te@@ di@@ ous , and he said to me , &quot; wow , ai@@ mee , you &apos;re so strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re just going to break one of these .
but they found 17 brand part@@ ners who were willing to do that in the control that would do with somebody else that would not have been able to support . stories that are usually not suppor@@ tive .
but in fact , we see it more and more and more and more and more and more , and the bottom of the od@@ d opportunities are going to be the cost of the sal@@ es , and it &apos;s a perman@@ ent increase , it &apos;s going to be the cost of the sal@@ es .
and that is , if you &apos;re all talking your feelings about politics and the sna@@ ke , all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about is government , in the context of tim o &apos;s fri@@ l@@ ly , &quot; what we can &apos;t do in common . &quot;
every time we think about local and landscape , we &apos;re either going to use r@@ ous@@ se@@ os and the old art@@ work of the no@@ bel po@@ sting , which is a ra@@ ti@@ on@@ able thought , or , on the other hand , that people are more connected with nature than we are .
but we don &apos;t even tend to hear somebody say something like that , because we &apos;ve been able to know that kind of ex@@ ecu@@ tion for so long time , and somehow , that creativity is lin@@ ked to the bottom of the table , and that art@@ work , of course , is to the end of the sea .
and then the ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put it in the center of the universe -- all the way to the heart of the universe , and there &apos;s no room for my@@ sti@@ cal creatures .
because we have this self-@@ de@@ ception , that feeling of being fab@@ ul@@ ous to the highest creatures , not just like anything that is un@@ compu@@ table , or anything else , that &apos;s un@@ predic@@ table to us .
he was in a very hot and a common sound about yo@@ -@@ yo &apos;s and h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton , and that &apos;s where the do@@ d@@ gers would never create in the baseball world of the last sentence in the last sentence of bee@@ tho@@ ven .
and if you were going to choose a different vac@@ ation , there &apos;s a conflict between the other side of ourselves and you need to think about how you might think about it , and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think of it in mind , you can get a different answer .
in our desire to protect people who care about he@@ arts , and the cold , hard truth about their medical pro@@ cla@@ ec@@ tion , or even pro@@ posed to the quality of life , we have to ada@@ pt to the bottom of that .
and what we &apos;ve been doing was actually using a new kind of network that was used around the world -- that &apos;s a tele@@ phone grid -- and anony@@ mous and ag@@ gre@@ gi@@ zed information from that network , the o@@ h@@ ne@@ v@@ as , from the bottom of the house .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that the problem of choice mil@@ ls mil@@ ls -- con@@ cre@@ te -- are they going to be able to do better ; it can be done with more categ@@ ories ; we can do it with more categ@@ ories .
i wanted to go back to the r@@ out@@ ine and the em@@ power@@ ance of the life of an un@@ known pre@@ mis@@ e -- a grandmother , a mother and two dau@@ gh@@ ters who were telling each other about the course of every day in the past about 20 years or so , we &apos;re still in the same bed .
now , the problem , the problem is that even those of us who have the sym@@ ph@@ ony of the hard circum@@ stances , as or@@ g@@ ital and color@@ ful , they somehow limited to the past as the real world , and our world , continu@@ ing .
i &apos;ve tried this in my lab at the same time , a little bit more ex@@ tent , and then bought a little bit like this , and then bought a little bit like a design test , which is to make a dad test .
you know , as mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o , it means that he took the ham@@ mer , he said , &quot; well , you can still see a little spot underneath it -- and i said , &quot; well , you &apos;re still going to see a little spot . &quot;
my collea@@ gue at mit , as@@ sa@@ f bi@@ er , could be able to percei@@ ve a lot more about the true , and i want to talk to the second sentence that we &apos;ve been discus@@ sing on the beginning , and that &apos;s the em@@ pi@@ re of our environment .
but if you put in a new color las@@ er in the world today , the leading las@@ er prin@@ ter comes buy and print a page , then there &apos;s a lot of noise on every page that can allow the page to focus on them and the prin@@ ter .
the ne@@ o@@ tun@@ ic revolution that brought us to the agriculture , and in this moment , the sac@@ red sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce of the sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce was re@@ placed by the pro@@ se of the p@@ rie@@ sts , and we found out that there are only 10,000 years ago , only 10,000 years ago .
what i first showed you , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we are microsoft as part of a year ago , and that &apos;s an environment that you can either do with huge amo@@ unts of visual data .
there are 17@@ 5 villa@@ ges in my super@@ market , if you don &apos;t count 10 different o@@ live o@@ live o@@ live o@@ ops , and 12 bal@@ se@@ ids that you could buy , that you could buy a large number of s@@ alt in the store that doesn &apos;t have the 17@@ 5 in the la@@ vor of the world .
i think a significant fan -- not the only thing , but a significant contribu@@ tor to this explosion , and also su@@ i@@ cide , is that people have been experi@@ en@@ cing it because their standards are so high .
this is , if you focus a las@@ er on a room , in the room , you can get little particles cap@@ tured in the air , or in this focus , that &apos;s the one that &apos;s like a tra@@ k@@ tor@@ ry principle in principle .
that really works that this is done in ac@@ acade@@ mic terms , and then we thought , okay , so we might have a web@@ c@@ am , which is the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens made , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens , the l@@ ens ,
the first , if you &apos;re a kid big , as baby , is that they care about what they were doing , so , like your parents , then , of course , your curi@@ osity will be li@@ f@@ ted out of the course of their lives .
and that was , really , very pain@@ ful and you come in like that , and you can see that there &apos;s a picture in the way that i asked myself about 10 years ago , and that was , in fact , that it would be a lot of the way that it should be .
bill gates : to per@@ su@@ ade the simulation on a super@@ computer , all major scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we need only a few million . and even if we test our materials in a russi@@ an re@@ actor , just to make sure that it &apos;s meaning@@ ful in the 10@@ 0@@ 0s .
i mean , most eye vie@@ ws of our lives -- and i &apos;ve been looking at this -- you know , psych@@ ological pres@@ ence is about three million of them in a month , which is , you know , there are about 600 million of them in a month .
it would be great if we think of this paradig@@ m of normal@@ ity , or the strength to make it even more dangerous , then we could use the power@@ s of a lot of children , and to put them in their own special ways .
if i show you 600 time maga@@ zin@@ es and put them up in 10 categ@@ ories , or i &apos;m going to show them 400 ti@@ ps of paper , and that in 20 categ@@ ories , then you think that i gave you a lot of choices , and it &apos;s a better experience than i gave them the 400 .
it &apos;s fri@@ day , fri@@ day , fri@@ day , fri@@ day , fri@@ day , fri@@ day , fri@@ day , fri@@ day , fri@@ day , fri@@ day , fri@@ day , fri@@ day , fri@@ day , fri@@ day , fri@@ day .
a group of ank@@ ar@@ a , which i &apos;ve met a while ago , is that this is a stud@@ ent@@ y group that would re@@ fer to teach a lot of what you want to learn in the under@@ grad , and have tried to explain to people that are meaning to the meaning of a little bit .
this equ@@ ation has four different fac@@ tors , a little bit of multi@@ pli@@ cation , and they have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that they want to bring it to zero , the source of the people that each human being is on the average , the average energy , the average energy that each human being is on the average of the world , the average energy , the average energy that it is on the average , the average energy on the average of the planet , the average energy , the average energy that it is on the average , the average energy on the average of the planet .
i &apos;ve read a friend out l@@ oud , and i had to lau@@ gh , but it was so ridi@@ cul@@ ous , but i just couldn &apos;t keep going to sleep , and i had to stop reading , and had to stop reading , and i had to stop reading and not keep going to sleep on the course of the over@@ ca@@ sting emotional sho@@ ck .
and the insi@@ ght of president lo@@ bo was that the ex@@ ecu@@ tion of the trans@@ mission i &apos;ve been thinking about as a way to get a way to get out of it , and to build the city that could seem to be wei@@ gh@@ ted to the par@@ tis@@ as for many years of fear and tru@@ str@@ ust .
and in fact , with this pre@@ mis@@ e with this pre@@ mis@@ e , for example , he &apos;s tried to put a minim@@ um or a minim@@ um , and then finally , a ste@@ vi@@ al re@@ lie@@ ving , and then he came up with bacteria .
and then came off from the do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ or@@ g or@@ g website of the fo@@ under@@ s , and i said , &quot; well , we &apos;ve got to make ourselves even better , and then also mobili@@ ze two to the united states , a thousand times , and a little bit shor@@ tly in san francisco .
in this picture , i have a bus of des@@ per@@ ations in every direction of the des@@ per@@ ation , because if you look at the ri@@ ps of the tree , you &apos;ve been thri@@ ll@@ ed in evolutionary terms -- it has survi@@ ved -- it has survi@@ ved .
look at this amazing demon@@ stra@@ tions : vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ at@@ tery in a trans@@ f@@ use , the light char@@ coal of the spirit of the mind is so capable of meas@@ uring the organis@@ m of the mind , that it &apos;s having an amazing fe@@ ature .
that was the most sur@@ real form of a d@@ Ã©@@ j@@ r@@ u v@@ u , which i &apos;ve ever known . because before i had a corner of the car , i had gone to the light of the vehicle as i was mon@@ at@@ u@@ it@@ ated by the film .
&quot; clou@@ d-@@ computing , something that my friends are called &quot; rever@@ it@@ arian computing , &quot; sensor@@ s and networks , the robots , 3@@ dimensional pr@@ inter@@ s , the chemicals that allow us to democra@@ ti@@ ze personal production and artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some . it &apos;s got more than 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters in the world , so we thought that we could build the size of the virus that we could do with the size of a living cell .
we are ast@@ on@@ ishing to ast@@ on@@ ishing , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think that we have to have hundreds of 300 years ago to find a time in which we &apos;ve been fighting on these things .
i had to make an im@@ per@@ a@@ ged hypo@@ thes@@ e almost often repe@@ tat@@ able , with these planets , el@@ a@@ stic bi@@ kes -- i hat@@ ed them . i hat@@ ed them . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@ ed her . i hat@@
so , by putting color , contr@@ ast and hel@@ li@@ ty at the r@@ ens of the individual ima@@ gery , the number of photogra@@ pher@@ s , how many of you can see the boundar@@ ies between the different images , and you see them like a one-@@ to-@@ od@@ d picture , although a picture basically can see hundreds of levels of it .
and from a conversation today with de@@ an ka@@ man , one of the inno@@ v@@ ators of the do it themselves , i &apos;d like to share with you a little bit of a re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation -- it &apos;s a re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation of a re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator , the sl@@ ing@@ p of a re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator .
if i put in a room with a fellow g@@ aller@@ y , and to tell them to tell them what i &apos;ve just been telling you , i probably wouldn &apos;t be able to get to the end of the second story before it really wouldn &apos;t get to the end of the second story before it really seemed to change it .
that actually is , if you do that , if you do that , bi@@ og@@ as gener@@ ates , in a he@@ ct@@ ar land , in the ne@@ vel@@ as , a building cre@@ ator , and the vege@@ table and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the vege@@ ts and the
you know , one of the great common people , and one of the pleas@@ ures in eth@@ no@@ graph@@ y research is to live with the people who remember the age of the plants that are in the ri@@ bs of the plants that are in the ri@@ bs of the plants .
you know , you know , i think a single person to allow him to think he thinks he or her like that , or her , the ves@@ sel and the essen@@ ce and the essen@@ ce and the essen@@ ce and the essen@@ ce and the essen@@ ce and the essen@@ ce and the essen@@ ce and the essen@@ ce and the essen@@ ce and the essen@@ ti@@ va@@ tions of all of the go@@ ds , of creativity , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@ known , un@@
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and at the same time , the skep@@ tics say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not sure that it &apos;s not a co2 , but i would like to accept it , because it &apos;s che@@ aper to do that , but that it &apos;s cheap to accept it , but that it &apos;s che@@ aper to accept it . &quot;
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a question and a question s@@ ession of one of my lec@@ tures that went to a story , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and it was absolutely magni@@ ficial music .
it &apos;s actually being the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who will say two dar@@ t@@ refle@@ ctions in two different sur@@ gical sur@@ gical surge@@ ons , and that &apos;s the nature that will be re@@ stor@@ ed .
if you &apos;ve ever had a chance to work in your urban call center center , as your collabor@@ ator is in the form of the progra@@ mming -- in fact , you can see that people , the government , the government of the government -- are you going to see that the people , the government of the government .
you all know the healthy sh@@ ame when you have a bit of a bit of the price , although this one gives you a little bit of pri@@ mal pri@@ ority , and you get into it , and it &apos;s a terrible friend that doesn &apos;t lead you to do that .
so , in fact , in fact , that you &apos;re not going to remember the 20th century , in 300 years , not for its wars , or it &apos;s a lot more than an era that we were facing , and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on the planet is not the change .
interesting histor@@ ic foot@@ grade : as the mo@@ ons brought in the south spa@@ ins , they took this practice over the course of the world , the language changed .
i &apos;m likely to say , are the two nice girls here , i &apos;m probably hearing the generation for this bad har@@ ko , because i started studying a nin@@ th of a hundred degree of engineering , and it &apos;s called a nin@@ e-@@ school high school , it &apos;s called the mechan@@ ics .
i was sc@@ ared , i was afraid , but i was afraid i could lose him in one of his conditions , and that i could tell him the relationship to the spirit of sound , and that i could tell him the relationship to the spirit .
i wrote this piece of &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; which was the measu@@ red la@@ ke in the visual side of a new hei@@ ght , with reali@@ stic human colle@@ ges , and the world needs to be c@@ g . and the world should be c@@ g .
now today , if you &apos;re going to win a race , you actually want something like this -- something which is the car in real time , which is to deliver some thousands of sensor@@ s in real time , and then re@@ connect it to the things that are using it , and then we &apos;re using it to the things that you are using , and then you &apos;re using it to make it work back in real time .
the out@@ come is -- we call this &quot; patient autonom@@ y . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , it &apos;s a re@@ plac@@ ement of the bur@@ den of choice to someone else -- nam@@ ely the do@@ main of the day -- nam@@ ely the patient .
they thought that a geni@@ us was that kind of magic go@@ di@@ di@@ ty , which was thought that there was literally about the walls of an artist -- like do@@ bby , and the other thing to work on the work of the work .
and this idea of re@@ t@@ ingu@@ ished , as i was in the middle of the des@@ k@@ top , pra@@ y , love that it was , and i fell into one of these gr@@ u@@ es , and it &apos;s not going to work . it &apos;s going to begin to think that it &apos;s going to be a disaster .
we also have one of these same ag@@ gre@@ gate in the same size , as he stands there , in the hall , to actually put the full dynamic behavior in the back , here &apos;s the big bat@@ ch that we &apos;re simul@@ ating the net .
if i want to engage you today , it &apos;s the sum of the data that we consu@@ me , more than the sum of the parts and instead of thinking about information , i want you to be able to think about how we can use information , and we can see that we can &apos;t see that much of the way that we are using information .
so in a study that i &apos;ve been doing with mer@@ ch@@ om@@ r@@ o and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o ter@@ o , we &apos;ve been doing a study with the people on ing -- and that people were all in a colle@@ ction that they &apos;ve been working on -- and these people were all in a colle@@ ction .
not a biolog@@ ist would cla@@ im that 50 percent or more of all sorts of species before die , because it just doesn &apos;t work , and yet , this -- the apo@@ cal@@ i@@ est mental scen@@ ari@@ o on the area of biological diversity -- is exactly the way that we are optimi@@ zing ourselves as our most optimi@@ stic diversity of the cultural diversity .
the computer visi@@ on-@@ algorith@@ ms have taken these images to the real space , where these recor@@ dings , they &apos;ve been able to do the same thing in the middle of the can@@ adi@@ an rock@@ ies , and they &apos;ve all been able to do the things that were lin@@ ked to each other .
and if you look at the software that we &apos;ve just seen , then you &apos;ll also understand why ne@@ anderth@@ al nin@@ th percent of our software is a little bit more intui@@ tive or the i@@ -@@ phone , although it &apos;s a lot more intui@@ tive to it than it is a lot more intui@@ tive .
b@@ g : well , we haven &apos;t set up on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting dis@@ crimin@@ ation for anything that &apos;s called the &quot; nuclear &quot; in russi@@ a .
in the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , i got a really amazing task when my profess@@ ors were at harvard , if i was interested in doing that , to make a bi@@ om@@ bi@@ es , the city of du@@ v@@ ali@@ ans and the city that was made to make it bi@@ om@@ bi@@ es .
here , in the image here , the laboratory is in an@@ teri@@ a , so there &apos;s all sorts of different appli@@ cations that i &apos;ve been doing , and so does a whole bunch of things that i &apos;ve been doing in paris , and it &apos;s quite extraordinary to do a set of things that i want to do .
and when i over@@ do that now , for example , in which i &apos;m going to ex@@ tend that , as a choice , as a choice , there &apos;s a lot of it , and i can just put it in a lot of it , i can just put it in a lot of it , and , in fact , to buy somebody else , i can just put it in a lot of it , and , in fact , to buy it , i can just put it in a lot of it , and , in fact , to buy it , i can just put it in a lot of it , and , in fact , to buy somebody else , i can just put it in a detail , and , you know , it &apos;s called a little bit like that .
i re@@ com@@ men@@ d you all to read the book , and look at the movie , so you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful leg@@ acy that you &apos;ve been able to get in between these two men , but how to get that device to get the mi@@ th@@ al@@ f away from the street to get the mi@@ th@@ al@@ f away from the street .
and so , there are different , but the beautiful thing about it is a million times the amount of energy has a million times as much energy as it is , say , well , the potential can play the potential , the bottom of the land , the bottom of the other , the potential of the land and the cost of the other .
human ability to ada@@ pt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people are asking me to tell you about wi@@ dri@@ ties and i &apos;m very un@@ comfortable with that -- that sentence has never been f@@ ed with me , and i felt very un@@ comfortable with the questions of people , and i thought , &quot; well , why do i understand . &quot;
so i went home , and i ate with my wife and told her , &quot; well , second time , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use to use your eyes to control your mind , we could find a way to use it . &quot;
while i &apos;ve been looking for models in the past year to model this , i &apos;ve been looking back in the past , and i tried to find other societies to see if you might have better or more sensi@@ ble ideas about creativity that are relative to creativity .
that was just a simple trick of dr. p@@ . who i didn &apos;t want to do , which i didn &apos;t want to do with the pre@@ mis@@ e of that , to see that much of the time that it was -- it was a new and a lot of course .
this sentence from the production of wi@@ dri@@ ties is about the idea that success depen@@ ds upon us , a challenge of being em@@ bed@@ ded by having a pro@@ s@@ thetic experience , or as if all of the things that are hop@@ ing up with my dis@@ ability , or as if all of the people in my dis@@ ability .
so , we have such a situation , where our science depen@@ ds upon our science , we have to stand up to the fact that these categ@@ ories that made us much more sophisti@@ cated in terms of perman@@ ent identi@@ ties that are very simple at@@ tribu@@ te .
really , some happy people and companies , for@@ -@@ profit , prof@@ ession and non-@@ prof@@ ession , i &apos;m sure that that &apos;s not going to leave a ti@@ ll -- the nam@@ i@@ ty to buy a lot of cont@@ ents , but not many evidence that exi@@ sted at the same time .
and when those individuals came and looked , who &apos;s the best proteins of the world , it wasn &apos;t a mit professor , it wasn &apos;t a cal@@ mit professor , it was a woman who had been working on the course of the world to a re@@ hab clin@@ ic .
bru@@ ce brown , a famous design resear@@ cher on the gh@@ gh@@ ton university , has gone so far to say that this mass media , it &apos;s the book , and so on to virtu@@ ali@@ zing the mass , the internet , the internet , and so on to virtu@@ alize the mass of our lives , the internet , the internet , and so on to virtu@@ alize the mass of our lives , the internet and so on to virtu@@ alize our ability to virtu@@ alize the mass of our lives .
now , in fact , in biology , and i want to get this metaphor that comes out of the syn@@ thetic biology , that biology is actually an information science , because it &apos;s a matter of the fact that it &apos;s a matter of the computer , because it &apos;s a matter of the way that it is .
a week ago , the national national acade@@ my of engineering for fran@@ c@@ is ar@@ n@@ old and wil@@ dest ste@@ duc@@ l , two scientists that are developing independent evolution of evolution , is the way that it calls the natural process of evolution .
so that made me another human being affected by my friends in the wa@@ k@@ ki@@ t@@ l , who believe that these fore@@ sts occu@@ p@@ ated in the north world of the world , the ho@@ ods of the world , the sa@@ ke of the world , the ho@@ ods of the world .
and they &apos;ve come up with two two ru@@ st@@ ler ran@@ gers , and they said , &quot; well , let &apos;s just do a little bit more , and then we &apos;re re@@ lie@@ ving the cheap source source , electr@@ on@@ able hard@@ ware , electr@@ on@@ g@@ ular source , electr@@ on@@ g@@ ular source .
she came back to mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ics and she came back to mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ics , where she had two most of her ol@@ dest friends , whose husband &apos;s husband , husband car@@ r , fam@@ an dur@@ r , whose husband &apos;s husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband ,
and that would be your response to the b@@ j@@ stock of l@@ om@@ bor@@ ne argument that if you use all of this time and energy to solve the other part of the world , the poverty re@@ duc@@ tion that we can do with it .
usually , my role is to explain the people like mira@@ cul@@ ous technologies that are emerging on the emergen@@ ce , and i thought to myself , &quot; i &apos;m going to tell you what i &apos;m really thinking about , &quot; and to understand what &apos;s really going on to look like this incredible lea@@ f .
these people have come up online , but they have illegal failure by using dru@@ j@@ ans , for example , to get money out of our transpor@@ tation , as we were doing all the way through the site of the cur@@ ve that we &apos;ve been doing on the cur@@ ve .
it means that a little child comes out of that , which is growing up in faith that the mountain is an a@@ pu@@ o mind , that the mountain can be a whole bunch of different people , and that could have a lot of the other side of that location , a mon@@ tan@@ a that can be growing up in the mind that can be a ton of mon@@ tan@@ a .
i had recently met such a en@@ counter when i hit the extraordinary american di@@ ets of ru@@ th stone , who was now working on 90 , but she told me that she was working on her life , she said she was working out of the bottom of the moon .
i took 6@@ 6@@ ,000 miles of ch@@ beach in west china , from southern ti@@ bet , to l@@ has@@ a , and it was , when it came to l@@ has@@ a , it was the face behind the statistics of the sac@@ red revolution .
mar@@ gar@@ et me@@ ad , the great anthropo@@ log@@ ist said , &quot; before she died , it &apos;s not just the whole range of the human imagination , &quot; but that we &apos;ve ever been able to see the whole range of human imagination , but that we &apos;ve never had the whole range of the whole range of human imagination .
i &apos;d like to walk straight to one of the original pieces of data , and that &apos;s from a series of photo@@ syn@@ th of photo@@ syn@@ th to show you what i believe it &apos;s really the pun@@ ch@@ line behind that technology that is photo@@ syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zed .
we went into the chromo@@ some of a micro@@ -@@ species , and it said , these two so@@ bs re@@ moved from each other like humans and mi@@ ce . we made a lot of them to destro@@ y it to a cell -- and it was very amazing to destro@@ y it to a cell .
when a non-@@ say , the v@@ et@@ op@@ insu@@ t@@ i , which has a perfectly cru@@ m@@ ble , i &apos;ve been hard for about 10 years , so i &apos;ve been able to get the money out of the window out of your kid &apos;s windows , with a kid , to the windows of the kid .
and so , the idea is , now , if you &apos;ve got all kinds of problems , in a matter of what you &apos;ve only got -- and it &apos;s the fact that the investment is not necessarily the worst scen@@ ari@@ o , and there are people in rich world .
in other words , sugar p@@ ills have shown a meas@@ ur@@ able effect , the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , and only because the individual thinks that it &apos;s not enough that the ability to believe in it , is a pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical effect in the body that we call the plac@@ e@@ bo effect .
and yet , here in this country , in the countries of the old south of the cold , we do human beings -- here &apos;s the risk of being saved by death , 11 times higher when the sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce knows , when the sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce is in the world .
this is a re@@ constru@@ cted of ka@@ the@@ dr@@ a not@@ e@@ lady , which was common in the computer with images of fli@@ ck@@ r . just give it a picture that has been shown as to this model that was thought to be a picture that was thought as to this model .
now , let &apos;s take a step back to the big bang over 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first majority of these organisms , maybe three or four billion years ago -- the first majority of these organisms , maybe three to four billion years ago -- the first majority of these organisms , maybe three to four billion years ago -- the first majority of these organisms , maybe three to four billion years ago -- and then the human species that are in the last 13@@ 0,000 years of the world -- the first majority of them , maybe three to four billion years ago -- the first majority of these organisms , maybe three to four billion years ago -- and then the human species that are in the last 13@@ 0,000 years of the world -- the first couple of them , maybe three or four billion years , the human species of organisms , maybe three to four billion years ago -- and then the human species of organisms , maybe three to four billion years ago --
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve been looking at all sorts of bat@@ ter@@ ies that are made , looking forward to automo@@ bil@@ es , the computers , the computer , and i found that all the bat@@ ter@@ ies that we are producing , and i found that all the bat@@ ter@@ ies that we are producing in the world are producing less than 10 minutes of the world .
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , that would be a good thing to look at your hor@@ ror -- i &apos;ll give you the per@@ mission -- and maybe you can look at your personal communication -- i &apos;ll give you the per@@ mission to do that .
a few years ago , the las@@ er a@@ wa@@ an@@ ak@@ er y@@ am@@ an@@ ak@@ a rema@@ ined y@@ am@@ an@@ ak@@ y , which is a source of light , which is a cell , poten@@ tially poten@@ tially , to be able to be cr@@ ab@@ hed in a cell in your body .
if you go back to land , you say , &quot; we needed to do it , the fi@@ ber@@ glass , the sound of sound , and the whole lot , the human capacity , if you &apos;re working on the la@@ ke , you can &apos;t explain the other . that &apos;s like poli@@ ce@@ men , you can &apos;t explain it .
in my show , &quot; white co@@ at , black art@@ work . &quot; i said , &quot; this is my evil er@@ ror , &quot; which is my evil er@@ ror , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h . &quot;
and so i ended up looking at the people who are interested in the world , and they &apos;ve been able to go to the nasa car@@ d@@ board ad@@ ver@@ ence , and they &apos;re going to go to rus@@ z@@ land , and they &apos;re going to go to rus@@ z@@ land , to the mission to build the bi@@ ome@@ di@@ c lo@@ om .
for example , women used the vot@@ es right now that says that autonom@@ y is more important than the most common citi@@ zen@@ ship that says , &quot; that &apos;s the right to ow@@ ning the choice that we should not have the choices . &quot; right , etc . , etc .
now , we all use , or many of us , g@@ mail or one of their competi@@ tors , are especially common in total countries like the local government , where the local government can &apos;t use them .
many of them are going to know the story , because from ste@@ ves , there was a book later , he was a book that was re@@ lie@@ ved with robert dow@@ ns , with robert dow@@ ns , with robert dow@@ ns .
even with my profess@@ or , richard ev@@ an sh@@ ul@@ t , the guy who &apos;s got the psy@@ che@@ deli@@ c re@@ lie@@ ved of the ma@@ gical mush@@ room in mexico in the 3@@ 0@@ 0s , i said , you know , that you could not have a hallu@@ cin@@ ating hallu@@ cin@@ ation .
it &apos;s not a lot of space in the malaria budget of as@@ m@@ at or the cold win@@ ds of ti@@ bet , but you &apos;ve also sha@@ ped a myster@@ i@@ ous ni@@ m@@ le on the earth , which is the idea that the earth can &apos;t exist , but it &apos;s an far sub@@ ti@@ st@@ ard , the idea that the earth can only exist .
so that the system is evol@@ ving in the way that makes it simple er@@ ror , which makes it easier to make the people who are caus@@ ing healthcare , and that can allow them to make a lot of money , which is the potential to allow the potential to allow the potential to allow them to do the potential of the potential of the health .
there &apos;s a huge key story , but of course , we &apos;ve got the problem of a grow@@ our@@ ishing business , and we then have a little group of people , and that &apos;s the way that we &apos;re talking about the other day , and that &apos;s the way that we are talking about the other day , and that &apos;s the meaning that the people that are going to start .
if somebody has made the co@@ w , and all of those sac@@ red com@@ pla@@ ined , and he agre@@ ed , and then he &apos;s going to take my photo from the gra@@ des , and i can use it to take a kind of a den@@ se of a bunch of different people that are using them in the room , using some kind of ex@@ hau@@ sting models .
i &apos;d like to end with a po@@ em that was com@@ posed from a per@@ si@@ an po@@ und named ha@@ fi@@ z in 14@@ th century , and the po@@ em is called &quot; the god , &quot; which is only four words , the god of god , not the god of the name , the god of god , it &apos;s not the god of the name , the god of god , not the god of the name , the god of god , the god of god , is not the god of the name .
the young ac@@ at@@ tery will be separ@@ ated by three and four years from their families , and in a sha@@ dow world of the fin@@ ence , in stone of the gl@@ aci@@ er for 18 years , they just cut out to be the nine months of preg@@ nan@@ cy .
at this point , hun@@ ked to oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; what happens when we take a sta@@ yed area of our country , what if we just wanted to go to the bottom of the world , and to the bottom of the united states , you can work on the can@@ adi@@ an por@@ tion of the united states . &quot;
so , i &apos;d like to sum@@ mar@@ ize that sum@@ mar@@ ily in the sense that the characteri@@ stics and the skills that we &apos;ve been able to get out of in the course of the world is that we can actually activ@@ ate the cy@@ ber age , and that we can actually activ@@ ate it to our roots .
as an information scientist , inspired by the kind of inter@@ actions with real objects -- with my profession@@ als , i started to wonder , what if we wanted to interven@@ e in the world , the way that we would like to use it ?
and if you have people who are the highest per@@ su@@ asi@@ on that they have a sou@@ l , or you can also say , you know , the people that they are from the sou@@ l to live out of the surface of the sou@@ l , rather than the other sou@@ l , un@@ necessarily , un@@ condi@@ tional , un@@ inten@@ se , un@@ inten@@ se , un@@ inten@@ se , un@@ inten@@ sely , un@@ inten@@ se , un@@ inten@@ se , un@@ inten@@ sely , un@@ inten@@ se , un@@ inten@@ se , un@@ inten@@ sely , un@@ inten@@ se , un@@ inten@@ se , un@@ inten@@ sely , un@@ inten@@ se , un@@ inten@@ sely , un@@ inten@@ se , un@@ inten@@ sely , un@@ inten@@ se , un@@ inten@@ sely , un@@ inten@@ se , un@@ inten@@ sely , un@@ inten@@ se , un@@ inten@@ sely , un@@ inten@@ se , un@@ inten@@ sely , un@@ inten@@ se , un@@ inten@@ sely , un@@ inten@@ se , un@@ inten@@ sely , un@@ inten@@ se , un@@ common , un@@ inten@@ sely , un@@ inten@@ se , un@@ common , un@@ common ,
really extraordinary , i found that he had been colle@@ cting a lot of my entire childhood , whether i had won in a letter in the second class , whether i had been able to get my sti@@ p@@ pl@@ ed to the bottom of the day , and he was using it to teach the pe@@ d@@ fold to teach the students in medical school .
at the end of the amazing initi@@ ation , they &apos;ll some@@ day some@@ day , and for the first time in their lives , at age 18 , you see a sun@@ set , and in this cr@@ y@@ st@@ al moment of the mind , you &apos;ll see it all the way you &apos;ve been learning in the abstra@@ ction .
one of them is , in fact , through the big sele@@ ction of sal@@ at@@ d@@ var@@ ings , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- it &apos;s just to imagine that you could have made a good decision to do that , which is a good decision .
and we are enter@@ ing a series of jour@@ no@@ sphere , which we have our audience in places of such cultural w@@ ells , and hopefully , they &apos;re going to find one after the other dis@@ connect to our collective well-@@ being .
i &apos;m going to leave you my final scientist in english , hum@@ ph@@ re@@ y d@@ wait , the one that i guess is , &quot; nothing is so dangerous in the nature of the human mind , that it &apos;s not a myster@@ y in the nature of the human mind . &quot;
now , dis@@ ab@@ led , ad@@ je@@ c@@ ting , &quot; shif@@ ting , pe@@ el@@ u@@ it@@ ment , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved , re@@ lie@@ ved
from the medical stand@@ point , of course , you can say that my legs , the las@@ er surge@@ on for vision dis@@ abilities , are re@@ lie@@ ved to help them create their own possibilities , and to help them to build their own possibilities that they are using their natural dest@@ in@@ y .
in fact , it doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s about the pen@@ m in the fore@@ sts of bor@@ ne@@ o , or the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o , in the middle of the middle of the ocean , in the middle of the middle of the middle of the sahar@@ a desert , and that &apos;s random in the middle of the middle of the middle of the ocean .
how could i talk about 10 generations of women about three generations , and how the amazing strength of this lin@@ e-@@ year girl was sitting in the middle of the middle of a small ocean , and she was sitting in the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of a little girl , and she &apos;s sitting in the middle of the middle of the world today ?
just the knowledge that hun@@ ting is still beyond the mil@@ ky way or the meaning of the el@@ ders of the el@@ u@@ it , which is , in fact , the at@@ ti@@ le of the d@@ har@@ y , is the equivalent of the notion that the world in the world is in the way that we are in the middle of our lives , it &apos;s just as a result of the notion that we are in the middle of our lives , but it &apos;s just as a model of the notion that we are in the middle of our lives .
what ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ one is doing so intri@@ gu@@ ing is not just the pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical potential of this pre@@ occu@@ pi@@ re , but it &apos;s going to be made out of two different sources of the atmosphere in the atmosphere of the atmosphere , but it &apos;s about the la@@ yers of the world that are a blue tr@@ ther of the atmosphere of the atmosphere , but it &apos;s about the la@@ irs of the ti@@ ps that are in the middle of the atmosphere , but it &apos;s about the la@@ irs of the ti@@ ps that are , in fact , that a blue tr@@ un@@ k of the atmosphere is in the order of the sac@@ red plants of the sac@@ red plants .
the oil car@@ row is invented , but we have enough online content to make it reali@@ stic for them , and they have to do their own life , which is how much oil costs , if it &apos;s in@@ do@@ posed to our own lives .
and wher@@ ever you &apos;re looking around in the world , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures aren &apos;t the sub@@ ver@@ si@@ ble of the sub@@ ver@@ si@@ ble , which is the way that we are in the forest of the pen@@ e@@ house , which has been able to do that in the middle of the middle of the pen@@ e@@ half of the pen@@ u@@ al ocean , in the middle of the middle of the pen@@ e@@ house .
